<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This little book is an attempt to present Reid in a fresh
light, and in his relations to present-day thought. It deals
with the Scottish chapter in that enduring alternation between
agnostic despair and endeavour after perfect insight
which seems to be a law of the philosophic progress of
mankind. Thomas Reid, home-bred and self-contained,
is the national representative, in the eighteenth century, of
the <i lang="la">via media</i> between these extremes. In the concluding
chapter I have looked at the philosophical appeal to inspired
data of Common Sense, in the wider light of the theistic
philosophy of the universe, and not merely as part of an
inductive science of the human mind. This connects the
theistic postulate of spiritual reason, as the foundation of
human experience, with Reid’s appeal to the ultimate but
often dormant necessities of human nature, a subject
treated more fully in my <cite>Philosophy of Theism</cite> (1896).</p>

<p>For valuable unpublished material—more indeed than I
could avail myself of within narrow limits—I am indebted
to Miss Hilda Paterson, the guardian of manuscript remains
and other relics of her ancestor, preserved at Birkwood, in
Reid’s native country of the Dee. I also owe much to
Mr. R. S. Rait, now of New College, Oxford, the historian
of the Universities of Aberdeen, whose research has done
much to illustrate his <i lang="la">alma mater</i> in the North. And I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
am indebted to Dr. Davidson, the Professor of Logic,
and to Mr. Anderson, the Librarian, of the University of
Aberdeen, for documents to which the space at my disposal
forbids more than an occasional reference.</p>

<p>Those who desire to study further the chapter in the
history of European philosophy in which Reid’s name is
prominent, may be referred to Cousin’s critical appreciation
in his <cite>Philosophie Écossaise</cite> (1857), and to Professor
Andrew Seth’s Balfour Lectures on ‘Scottish Philosophy’
(1885), in which the Scottish and German answers to
Hume are compared. The industry of the late Dr.
M’Cosh has collected, in his <cite>Scottish Philosophy</cite> (1875),
interesting particulars regarding our national philosophers
from Hutcheson to Hamilton.</p>

<h1>THOMAS REID</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">BOYHOOD AND ANCESTRY: STRACHAN AND THE
VALLEY OF THE DEE<br />1710-1722</span></h2>

<p>Thomas Reid makes his first appearance as a boy in
the manse of Strachan in Kincardineshire, where he
entered this world of sense on the 26th of April 1710.
His father, the Rev. Lewis Reid, was minister of the parish
for fifty-eight years, from 1704 until his death in 1762.
The mother, Margaret Gregory, was the eldest daughter, by
his second marriage, of David Gregory, laird of Kinairdy
in Banffshire. An elder son, David, born in 1705, and
two daughters, Isobel and Jane, with Thomas, formed the
family at the manse when Thomas was a boy. David was
twice married, and died about 1780, without issue; the
elder daughter, Isobel, died unmarried, in her stepmother’s
house at Aberdeen, in 1770; and the younger, Jane, after
a <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>, died without issue after the middle of the
century. Their mother, Margaret Gregory, died in 1732,
when the manse was still the home of Thomas. In 1735,
Mr. Lewis Reid married his second wife, Janet, daughter
of Fraser of Phopachy in the county of Inverness. Two
sons and five daughters were the issue of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
marriage. The eldest son died when a student at Marischal
College, in 1758, and the younger, who studied medicine,
died in London about ten years later. Of the daughters,
one died in infancy, and two others, Elizabeth and Mary,
died unmarried—the former in Edinburgh in 1772, and the
latter in Aberdeen in 1771. Of the other two, Margaret
became in 1763 the wife of the Rev. Alexander Leslie,
minister of Fordoun in Kincardineshire, and Grace married
the Rev. John Rose, minister of Udny in Aberdeenshire.
Mrs. Rose died in 1793, and Mrs. Leslie in 1829, the last
survivor of the Reid family circle at Strachan.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is recorded of the father of this large family that he
was respected for piety, prudence, and benevolence, inheriting
from his ancestors simplicity of manners, and literary
tastes which, without attracting the notice of the world, engaged
his leisure and dignified his rural life. Of the two
wives, the second survived her stepson, the philosopher.</p>

<p>The remote parish of Strachan is formed by the romantic
valley through which the Feugh finds its way from the
Grampians to the Dee at Banchory-Ternan—a breezy
upland region, redolent of heather and bog-myrtle, apt in
its solitude to educate reflective individuality in one so
disposed. In those days the road to the south over the
Cairn o’ Mount passed through Glen Dye, under the
shadow of Clochnaben, a road two centuries ago frequented
by robbers, and invested with a halo of romance by tales
of marvellous adventures. But Glen Dye has an interest
of another kind. Centuries ago it was the home and property
of the family of Cant, from whom Andrew Cant,
the noted Covenanting preacher, was descended,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with whom the more widely celebrated Immanuel Kant,
chief factor in the philosophical thought of modern Europe,
claimed connection. Strachan is thus associated in imagination
with two of the most illustrious thinkers of the
eighteenth century. Thomas Reid is in this way connected
locally with his famous German philosophical contemporary,
as well as by parallels in their lives which appear in the
sequel, and by spiritual analogies in their philosophy.
They are moreover united by their common antagonism to
the scepticism of David Hume, who also through them is
associated with the moorland valley of the Feugh, making
it suggest to fancy three memorable intellectual figures.
In Scotland David Hume and Thomas Reid are the two
greatest names of their century in philosophy.</p>

<p>Imagination is our only guide when we try to picture the
boyhood of Thomas Reid in the homely surroundings at
Strachan. The one recorded fact about him is, that in his
tenth year the home education of the manse was followed
by two years spent in the neighbouring parish school of
Kincardine O’Neil. Thus far no signal signs of future
eminence appeared. He was, it seems, an unprecocious
youth, remarked for modesty and patient industry. The
insight of the schoolmaster is said to have found in him
the rudiments of a man of ‘good and well-wearing parts.’
I wish that some further record could be found of this
sagacious prophet of his pupil’s steady mental concentration,
and I have not discovered why the boy was placed
in the Kincardine school. This dim picture is our only
one in the first twelve years of his life.</p>

<p>The lack of personal incident in those years is in a
manner compensated by the interest of an illustrious
ancestry—Reids and Gregories. He inherited mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through his father, but much more through his mother,
with whom he shared the unique celebrity of a family
which in successive generations shed lustre on the valley
of the Dee—a memorable example of inherited intellect.</p>

<p class="tb">In the end of the fourteenth century certain lands of
Pitfodels, between the bridge of Dee at Aberdeen and the
Den of Cults, became the property of William Reid, a
kinsman of the former owner, Alexander Moray, ‘lord of
Culboyne.’ The lands remained in the Reid family until
the beginning of the sixteenth century, when Marion,
heiress of Alexander, the last Reid of Pitfodels, married
Thomas, the eldest son of Gilbert Menzies, a burgess of
Aberdeen, whose family was known thereafter for three
centuries as Menzies of Pitfodels. James Reid, the first
minister of Banchory-Ternan after the Reformation, was, it
seems, grandson of a younger brother of this Alexander of
Pitfodels; and Lewis Reid, the minister of Strachan, was in
direct descent from the minister of Banchory. It is told
of James Reid that he was ‘a man of notable head-piece
for witte, and the most of his children were men of extraordinary
qualifications.’ His eldest son, Robert, noted for
good sense, succeeded him at Banchory. The second son,
Thomas, was one of the numerous Scots famed for learning,
who migrated to the Continent in the end of the fifteenth
century and after. He was educated partly at Marischal
College, Aberdeen, where he was made regent about 1602.
He was afterwards in residence at Oxford and abroad:
he defended a thesis ‘<cite>De objecto Metaphysicæ</cite>’ at Rostock
in 1610. After his return to Britain he became Greek
and Latin Secretary to King James, some of whose works
he translated into Latin. Verses of his may be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in the ‘<cite>Delitiæ Poetarum Scotorum</cite>.’ Alexander, the next
brother, was physician to Charles I., and author of works
in physiology well considered at that time. John, a
brother of the minister of Banchory, translated into ‘the
Scottishe tunge’ Buchanan’s <cite>History of Scotland</cite>, and this
unpublished version is in the College of Glasgow. A
second Robert, grandson of the eldest of these four sons,
became minister of Banchory at the Restoration; he was a
member of the first Episcopal Synod at Aberdeen in the
restored Establishment (the Covenanting Alexander Cant
was his immediate predecessor); he died in 1682. Thomas,
the second son, ‘wadsetter of Eslie in Banchorie,’ was
father of the Rev. Lewis Reid of Strachan, by his wife,
Jane, a niece of Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys; and thus
young Thomas Reid at Strachan was related to the family
from which the historian Bishop Burnet was descended.
These Reids of Banchory rest in the old burial-ground
there, ‘not farre from the banke of the river Dee, expecting
the general resurrection, and the glorious appearing of
Jesus Christ there Redemier.’</p>

<p>But the Gregory connection of Thomas Reid through
his mother is, as I have said, more significant than the
Reid succession. During the Civil Wars of the seventeenth
century, the minister of the rural parish of Drumoak,
on the north side of the Dee, between Banchory and
Pitfodels, was the Rev. John Gregory, son of an Aberdeen
merchant, whose father was a M’Gregor from Glenlyon.
The Gregories of Deeside were thus descendants of the
clan Gregor of Glenlyon and Glenstrae, a circumstance
referred to by Sir Walter Scott in the Introduction to
<cite>Rob Roy</cite>. The minister of Drumoak married a lady
named Anderson, one of a family reputed for mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ability in successive generations. She inherited the genius
of her family, and transmitted it to her sons. Her
husband at Drumoak seems to have steered his cause
skilfully in that troubled time, for he bought the good
estate of Kinairdy, part of the heritage of the lordly
house of Creighton Viscount Frendraught. Alexander,
the eldest son of the Rev. John Gregory of Kinairdy, was
killed by one of the Creightons in a fray in 1663, and the
homicide was the occasion of a <i lang="fr">cause célèbre</i>. David, the
second son, succeeded his murdered brother in the lands
of Kinairdy, and shared in the mathematical inheritance
of the Gregories. For some reason he sold Kinairdy and
became an energetic merchant, spending part of his life
in Holland. This David of Kinairdy was twice married,
and father of twenty-nine children, which perhaps explains
the sale. The wife of the Rev. Lewis Reid of Strachan was
a daughter of the second marriage. Three of her brothers
were eminent Professors of Mathematics in British Universities—namely,
David, first at Edinburgh, and then at
Oxford, the friend of Newton; James, the successor of
David in Edinburgh; and Charles, who professed mathematics
at St. Andrews. David’s son was Professor of
History at Oxford from 1724 till 1767, and Dean of Christ
Church; and his cousin David succeeded to the chair
of Mathematics at St. Andrews. Two other Professors
were sons of two of ‘Kinairdy’s’ daughters—namely, our
Thomas Reid, and Alexander Innes, who professed Philosophy
in Marischal College. These all traced their birth
to the minister of Drumoak and his mathematical wife—through
their son David. But James, the third son of
the Drumoak manse, was not less illustrious in himself
and in his descendants. He was Professor of Mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
first at St. Andrews and then at Edinburgh,
inventor of the reflecting telescope, also Newton’s friend
and correspondent, who introduced the science of Newton
into the Universities of Scotland. It is of him that Whiston
writes from Cambridge:—‘He had already caused several
of his students to keep acts upon several branches of the
Newtonian philosophy; while we at Cambridge, poor
wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses
of the Cartesian.’ His son James became in 1725
Professor of Medicine in King’s College, Aberdeen, a
considerable local figure. He had two sons: James, who
succeeded his father, and John, a regent of philosophy
in his father’s college, afterwards Professor of Medicine
in Edinburgh, and remembered as the author of <cite>A
Comparative View of Man and the Animal World</cite>, and
<cite>A Father’s Legacy</cite>, books full of good sense. Dr. John
Gregory’s son, James, was Professor of Medicine in Edinburgh
from 1776 till 1821, a physician and a metaphysician—in
the sequel, the intimate friend and correspondent of
Thomas Reid, and the patron of Thomas Brown. Of
his family, one son held the Chair of Chemistry in King’s
College, and afterwards in Edinburgh till his death in
1858; another, Donald, was an eminent archæologist,
author of the <cite>History of the Western Highlands and
Islands</cite>; a third died in high mathematical repute at
Cambridge, returning to the original bent of this extraordinary
family, in which the disposition to mathematics
had latterly been overborne by medicine and moral philosophy.
Even this long list of names omits scientific
celebrities who were descended from the minister of
Drumoak and his wife, Margaret Anderson, more remotely
still from the wild clan Gregor of Glenlyon and Glenorchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>But the life of romantic adventure did not descend to
young Thomas Reid at Strachan. A disposition to look
at the world on its moral and religious side, perhaps
inherited from the Reids, with a strong bent to mathematics
and the scientific side of things, inherited from the
Gregories, along with his own patient, concentrated reflection,
was the inheritance of the boy ‘of good and well-wearing
parts’ who left the Kincardine school in 1722.
The long life that followed presents none of the outward
incidents that readily touch the popular fancy; but to those
awake to the higher problems of human life it touches
thought and imagination in another fashion. It has been
said that a human life should resemble a well-ordered
poem: the exordium should be simple and should
promise little. This condition is fulfilled in the life of
Thomas Reid, which, to the end, was modestly spent in
learned retirement, indifferent to vulgar fame. Its chief
interest lies in the spectacle of penetrating sagacity, independent
and sincere, steadily devoted to the invisible
world of thought and belief, in quest of the ultimate
foundations and guarantees of human knowledge. It
should attract those who, in an age of sceptical criticism,
seek to assure themselves of the final trustworthiness of
the experience into which, at birth, they were admitted as
strangers, ignorant of what the whole means, like the
agnostic in Pascal. Who has sent me into this life, I
know not; what the world around me is, I know not; nor
what I am myself. I find myself chained to one little
planet, but without understanding why I am here rather
than there; and why this period of time was given me to
live in rather than any other in the unbeginning and
endless duration. Life with its memories and forecasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
looks like a blind venture. The sum of my knowledge
seems to be that I must die; but what I am most
ignorant of is the meaning of death. One is drawn to
Reid by an interest in final questions like these, which
the agnostic spirit is now forcing upon us. It was the
sceptical disintegration of human knowledge and belief
that was going on in his own time that led Reid, with the
patience and persistency revealed in his boyhood, to devote
a long life to testing in his own sincere fashion man’s
intellectual and moral footing in that world of sense which,
all strange to it, he entered in the valley of the Feugh.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">AT MARISCHAL COLLEGE<br />1722-1737</span></h2>

<p>At the age of twelve Reid emerges out of the obscurity
in which his boyhood lies concealed from us. In one
of his letters to his cousin, Dr. James Gregory, written
in his old age, he mentions ‘April 1722’ as the date
of his first visit to Aberdeen, then a town of some eight
thousand inhabitants, and twenty miles distant from the
moorland valley in which he was born. He tells how
he was taken to see his grandmother, who was living
in Aberdeen, the second wife and widow of David
Gregory of Kinairdy. ‘I found her,’ he says, ‘old and
bedridden, but I never saw a more ladylike woman. I
was now and then called into her room, when she sat upon
her bed, or entertained me with sweetmeats and grave
advices. Her daughters that assisted her often, as well as
one who lived with her, treated her as if she had been of
a superior rank; and indeed her appearance and manner
commanded respect. She and all her children were zealous
Presbyterians: the first wife’s children were Tories and
Episcopalians.’ This picture of the boy in Aberdeen we
owe to his movement from the country school in the
valley of the Dee to the higher sphere of the Aberdeen
Grammar School, which he seems to have entered in
that April, encouraged perhaps by the prognostic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Kincardine schoolmaster. The Grammar School Register
tells that in ‘October 1722’ Thomas Reid left it to enter
Marischal College, where his name appears in the list
of those matriculated that autumn. It was an early age
for University life according to later ideas, but not at
variance with the custom of Scotland in those days.
Burnet, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, another eminent
Aberdonian, entered Marischal College when he was only
nine, and graduated when he was thirteen; and Burnet’s
contemporary, Reid’s granduncle, James Gregory, graduated
when he was not older than Burnet.</p>

<p>The uncouth and dilapidated structure in which the
University of the Earls Marischal was housed when young
Reid was spending his undergraduate years in it, bore no
resemblance to the stately College on the same site which
now adorns the prosperous city of Bon Accord. The
process of decay was so rapid, and the case was so urgent,
that a few years later the regents suspended their official
claim to a part of the scanty funds of the College, and
also asked help from the community, ‘to preserve from
ruin an university from whence so many accomplished
men have gone forth as ornaments of their country in
every age since its foundation.’ The troubles of 1715 had
further reduced its resources. Its Chancellor, the tenth
Earl Marischal, concerned in the rising of Mar, then forfeited
his title and the official connection of his family
with the academical foundation of his ancestor. The
Principal and most of the authorities had been removed
or suspended by a commission of visitation in 1717.
During the two years which followed the adventure of
Mar the doors of Marischal College were closed, so that,
when public instruction was resumed in 1717, a new race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of teachers was in possession, and, as it happened, an era
of intellectual activity was inaugurated.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the humble accommodation which it
offered, and the social revolution through which it had
lately passed, Marischal College could then boast of at
least three eminent teachers, imbued with the spirit of
the ‘new philosophy,’ and of the reviving literary taste
in Scotland. The Professor of Mathematics was Colin
M’Laurin, brother of the eloquent Presbyterian preacher,
himself among the foremost of British mathematicians, a
friend and correspondent of the aged Newton, who, along
with Reid’s inherited disposition, attracted the young
student to the study in which the teacher was a master.
And about the time when Reid entered College, Thomas
Blackwell, a critic of Homer, and author of <cite>Memoirs of
the Court of Augustus</cite>, prominent among his countrymen
who were anxious to write good English, became Professor
of Greek, and for a generation encouraged classical taste
and love of literature in the north of Scotland. But the
teacher who chiefly influenced Reid’s undergraduate life was
George Turnbull, a copious author, though his books are
little remembered now. He was Reid’s guide for three
years; for the College was then under a system of ‘regents’
which intrusted the student to the same teacher in all the
three years given to ‘philosophy’—natural as well as moral.</p>

<p>Reid was fortunate in entering Marischal College when
it was inspired by M’Laurin, Blackwell, and Turnbull, each
a leader in the scientific and literary awakening of the time.
The Aberdeen of 1725 was no longer the Aberdeen of the
ministers of whom Gordon in his <cite>Scots Affairs</cite> tells that
they shrieked, ‘downe with learning and up with Christ.’
Their religion was in alliance with culture and progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
intelligence, anticipating in the North the intellectual
enlargement associated in the West with the University of
Glasgow under Hutcheson, Leechman, and Adam Smith.</p>

<p>George Turnbull is little known now, but he is too
important a factor in the making of Thomas Reid to be
lightly passed over. He was an Edinburgh graduate, born
in 1698, and like Reid a son of the manse. He became
a regent of philosophy in Marischal College at the age of
twenty-three. The College record informs us that on the
14th of April 1726 he presented for graduation a band
of thirty-nine students: the name of Thomas Reid appears
last in the list. Turnbull’s lectures when he was regent
were in 1740 embodied in his <cite>Principles of Moral Philosophy</cite>.
His leading arguments are illustrated and vindicated
by quotations from Berkeley’s <cite>Theory of Vision</cite> and <cite>Principles
of Human Knowledge</cite>, also by the <cite>Inquiry</cite> of Francis
Hutcheson and the <cite>Sermons</cite> of Bishop Butler. The influence
of Berkeley is evident.</p>

<p>The mottoes on the title-page of Turnbull’s book express
his method of inquiry. One of them is the precept of
Pope—‘Account for moral as for natural things’; the other
expresses in the words of Newton the consequence which
may be expected to follow—‘If Natural Philosophy, in all
its parts, by pursuing this method, shall at length be perfected,
the bounds of Moral Philosophy will also be
enlarged.’ Turnbull was among the first in Scotland to
substitute, in mental philosophy, tentative study of the
facts of human nature for logical deduction from abstract
dogmas. ‘If a fact be actually found, either in the outer
world of sensible things, or in the inner and invisible world
of mind, there is no room for reasoning against it. Every
reasoning, however subtle, if it be repugnant in its conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to the actual fact of the case, must be sophistical.’
Turnbull is fond of repeating that facts presented to the
senses are not the only, nor yet the most important, facts
which the universe contains. The invisible facts which
take the form of beliefs and feelings and volitions are the
deepest facts of all: spirit and not matter at last regulates
life. Then he refers to what he calls ‘common sense’ as the
final arbiter in all questions. ‘Common sense is sufficient
to teach those who think of the matter with seriousness
and attention all the duties of common life; all our obligations
to God and our fellow-men; all that is morally fit and
binding.’ In a word, spiritual facts of mind are not to be
crushed out of existence by tangible and visible facts of
matter. That mind in the form of will is the only known
active power is another prominent lesson in Turnbull’s
teaching. ‘It is will alone that manifests power or productive
energy. To speak of any other active power in
the universe is to speak without meaning; because experience,
the source of all the materials of our knowledge,
does not lead us to any other conception of power.’
Turnbull’s conception of the material world is very like
Berkeley’s. Matter is the established or natural order in
which sense ideas present themselves. ‘Properly speaking,
what we call matter and space are only sensible ideas,
produced in us, according to an established or natural
order, by some external cause; for when we speak of
material things, we can only mean certain sensible perceptions
that arise in our minds, according to a fixed
order, but which are experienced to be absolutely inert or
passive, having in themselves no productive force.’ It
was in this philosophy that Turnbull’s most famous pupil
was educated at Marischal College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Turnbull’s official connection with the College lasted only
six years. After inaugurating moral philosophy in the
modern spirit in Scotland, he resigned in the spring of
1727, and, after some residence abroad, lived in London,
producing books in excess of the demand for them. He
ended by taking orders in the Irish branch of the Anglican
Church, finding the communion of Jeremy Taylor and
Berkeley more suited to his temper than the fervid Presbyterianism
to which he was accustomed in his youth. In
search of health, he died at the Hague in 1749.</p>

<p>I have enlarged on Turnbull, because by him Reid was
first attracted to the study of the human mind. But Blackwell,
the Professor of Greek, must not be forgotten. Blackwell,
as well as Turnbull, was connected with Berkeley. It
was when Reid was at Marischal College that Berkeley was
engaged in the most romantic missionary enterprise of that
age, for spreading Christian civilisation in America by
a College in the Bermudas. Curiously, Blackwell was
one of those whom he asked to join the little party of
missionaries who embarked with him at Gravesend in
September 1728, after he had surrendered high preferment
in Ireland in order to devote his life to a more cosmopolitan
philanthropy. The Aberdeen regent was not
prepared for the sacrifice. He refers thus to Berkeley’s
adventure:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In this respect I would with pleasure do justice to the
memory of a very great though singular sort of man, known as
a philosopher, and intended founder of a University in the
Bermudas or Summer Islands. An inclination to carry me out
with him on that expedition, as one of the young professors on
his new foundation, having brought us often together, I scarce
remember to have conversed with him on that art, liberal or
mechanic, of which he knew not more than the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
practitioners. With the widest views, he descended to the
most minute detail, and begrudged neither pains nor expense
for the means of information. I enter not into his peculiarities,
either religious or personal, but admire the extensive genius of
the man, and think it a loss to the Western world that his
noble and exalted plan of an American University was not
carried into execution.’—<cite>Memoirs of the Court of Augustus.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The fact that Berkeley was so much in evidence at
Marischal College in those days, through Turnbull and
Blackwell, is significant of much in the life of Reid.</p>

<p>If Reid recorded his thoughts when he was a student at
Marischal College, the record has been lost. A commonplace
book like Berkeley’s, when Berkeley was an undergraduate
in Dublin, would have cast welcome light on
this part of his mental history. The only extant revelation
of his inner life in these years is contained in a letter
written half a century after to his kinsman William
Gregory at Oxford. It relates to the period when his
year was divided between town and country—the winters
at Aberdeen and the long summer days at the manse of
Strachan:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘About the age of fourteen I was,’ he says, ‘almost every
night unhappy in my sleep from frightful dreams: sometimes
hanging over a dreadful precipice, and just ready to drop
down; sometimes pursued for my life and stopped by a wall,
or by a sudden loss of strength; sometimes ready to be
devoured by a wild beast. How long I was plagued with such
dreams I do not recollect. I believe it was for a year or two
at least; and I think they had left me before I was fifteen. In
those days I was much given to what Mr. Addison in one of
his “Spectators” calls <em>castle-building</em>; and in my evening
solitary walk (which was generally all the exercise I took), my
thoughts would hurry me into some active scene, where I
generally acquitted myself much to my own satisfaction, and
in those scenes of imagination I performed many a gallant
exploit. At the same time, in my dreams I found myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
most arrant coward. Not only my courage but my strength
failed me in every danger; and I often rose from my bed in
the morning in such a panic that it took some time to get
the better of it. I wished much to get free of these uneasy
dreams, which not only made me unhappy in sleep, but left a
disagreeable impression on my mind for some part of the
following day. I thought it was worth trying whether it was
possible to recollect while I was dreaming that it <em>was</em> all a
dream, and that I was in no danger. Accordingly, I often went
to sleep with my mind as strongly impressed as I could with this
thought—that I never in my lifetime had been in any real
danger, and that every fright I had was a dream. After many
fruitless endeavours to recollect this when the danger appeared,
I effected it at last, and have often, when I was sliding down a
precipice into the abyss, recollected that it was all a dream,
and boldly jumped down. The effect of this commonly was
that I immediately awoke; but I awoke calm and intrepid, which
I thought a great acquisition. After this my dreams were never
very uneasy; and in a short time I dreamed not at all. During
all this time I was in perfect health; but whether my
ceasing to dream was the effect of the recollection above
mentioned, or of any change in the habit of my body, which is
usual about that period of life, I cannot tell. I think it may
more probably be imputed to the last. However, the fact was
that for at least forty years after I dreamt none, to the best of
my remembrance; and finding from the testimony of others
that this is somewhat uncommon, I have often as I awoke
endeavoured to recollect, without being able to recollect anything
that passed in my sleep. The only distinct dream I ever
had since I was about sixteen, as far as I remember, was about
two years ago (1777). I had got my head blistered for a fall.
A plaster which was put upon it after the blister pained me
excessively for a whole night. In the morning I slept a little,
and dreamed very distinctly that I had fallen into the hands of
a party of Indians and was scalped. I am apt to think that, as
there is a state of sleep and a state wherein we are awake, so
there is an intermediate state which partakes of the other two.
I have slept on horseback, but so as to preserve my balance;
and if the horse stumbled, I could make the exertion necessary
to save me from a fall, as if I was awake.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In all this one detects the disposition to sober introspection,
which ripened as life advanced.</p>

<p class="tb">During the ten years that followed the graduation in
April 1726 we have only faint traces of Reid. In the
following winter he began to study theology, and in 1731 he
had completed the course required by the Church, under the
direction of Professor James Chalmers, father of the founder
of the <cite>Aberdeen Journal</cite>. This is another parallel between
Reid and Kant: both, it seems, were theologically trained.</p>

<p>Reid’s name first appears in the books of the Presbytery
of Kincardine O’Neil when he was in his nineteenth year.
Extracts from the minutes with which I have been favoured
record his progress with a quaint simplicity not without
interest, as part of the history of a philosopher:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘On the 17th of July, 1728, James Lumsden, John Beaton,
Thomas Reid, and David Ross, students in divinity, residing
within the bounds of the presbytery, being now present, the
presbytery thought fit to appoint each of them to be in readiness
to deliver a homily against the next meeting, and accordingly
appointed Mr. Reid to deliver a homily on John i. 29.—18
September 1728. This day Mr. Thomas Reid delivered
his homily, with which the presbytery being satisfied, the
moderator encouraged him to go on with his studies.—8th June
1731. The presbytery considering that Mr. Thomas Reid had
been allowed by the Synod to enter upon tryal, and he, being
upon the place, did undergo questioning tryal, wherein he was
approved, and the presbytery appointed him to be in readyness
to deliver a lecture on Ps. ii., and an exegesis on that common
head. <i lang="la">Num detur peccatum originale inherens.</i>—22nd September
1731. This day Mr. Thomas Reid underwent a questioning
tryal and was approved. And the presbytery taking into
consideration that he, having passed his course in Arts at the
College, and thereafter having studied Divinity for the space
of <a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> years, as also having resided for the whole of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
time within the bounds of this presbytery; and they looking
upon him as a person fit to be entered upon tryals, and also
having had sufficient testimonials from the professors of
divinity with whom he studied as to his proficiency in his
studys and good behaviour, he was admitted to the usual tryals
appointed by the Acts of the General Assembly of this Church,
and having passed through all the parts thereof, he was licensed
by the said presbytery to preach the Gospel of Christ, and
exercise his gifts as a probationer for the holy ministry.’</p>

</div>

<p>On the 2nd of August 1732, ‘the Presbytery chose Mr.
Thomas Reid to be their Clerk.’ On the 5th of October
in the same year, ‘the Presbytery appointed Mr. Thomas
Reid to supply at Lumphanan the second Sabbath after
Mr. Gordon’s removal.’ On the 8th of November, ‘Mr.
Thomas Reid was continued Clerk till the next meeting
of the provincial Synod,’ in April 1733.</p>

<p>In July 1733 Reid re-appears, this time not engaged in
ecclesiastical ministration, but as the librarian of Marischal
College. It was an office with which he had a family
connection. ‘The most outstanding name in the history
of Marischal College Library,’ says Mr. Rait, ‘is that of
Thomas Reid, Latin secretary to James vi., son of James
Reid, minister of Banchory-Ternan. In 1624 he left to
Marischal College his own library, 6000 merks to be invested
in land, and a sum of money to provide a salary
for a librarian.’ The secretary’s brother, Alexander, also
bequeathed books of philosophy and divinity. And David
Gregory of Kinairdy was for some time librarian. It
was an acceptable retreat for research, and a mark of
esteem from the College. Mr. Rose, Reid’s brother-in-law,
says that he then studied Newton’s <cite>Principia</cite> and Locke’s
<cite>Essay</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Again a parallel between Reid and Kant. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
time after Kant had taken his degree he was made librarian
in the Schloss Library, with a yearly stipend of about £10.
This was nominally in excess of Reid’s modest honorarium
of £9 at Aberdeen, a pittance which was for a time
suspended by threatened litigation. He was in active
service as librarian till 1736, and for two years more in
possession, ‘on leave of absence, with a substitute.’</p>

<p>The need for a ‘substitute’ in 1736 can be explained.
In that year, for the first time, Reid is found outside Scotland.
He is making a tour in England, with Stewart, the
friend of his undergraduate years, and now Professor of
Mathematics in Marischal College. The record of their
movements in the South is scanty. Reid’s uncle, Dr.
George Reid, then a physician in London, provided a
home for them in the metropolis; and as David Gregory,
Reid’s cousin, was Professor of History at Oxford, they
found another home on the Isis, with an easy introduction
to the colleges and social life of the great
English University. The Gregory connection also opened
the way to interesting things and persons at Cambridge
as well as at Oxford and London. Reid, it seems, saw
Bentley at Cambridge, ‘who delighted him with his
learning and amused him with his vanity’: here, too, he
enjoyed the conversation of the blind mathematician
Saunderson, whose experience he afterwards turned to good
account in his inquiries regarding the sense of seeing. One
would like to have had Reid’s first impressions of England,
its metropolis, its social and church life, and its ancient
colleges. It does not appear that the scenes through
which he moved awakened in him much historic sentiment;
that, like his contemporary Berkeley, Oxford would
be the ideal home of his old age; or that he was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
moved by its academic splendour, associated with what is
noblest in English history, and by the soft repose of the
surrounding rural scenes. In one of his letters to Dr.
James Gregory, he speaks of the first time he was in
‘Dean Gregory’s house at Oxford,’ when the Dean told
‘the story of the watch very well to a large company of
Oxonians’; so we may infer that other visits followed in
later life. And the Oxford of his first visit was the
degenerate Oxford described by Adam Smith and Gibbon,
who were in residence a few years after. Reid is seldom
again found out of Scotland. There is no sign that he ever
visited Ireland or the Continent in his retired, sedate,
and methodical life. In this, too, he was like Kant,
who in all his eighty years is said never to have travelled
more than forty miles from his native Königsberg. The
stay-at-home disposition common to both is not unlike
the character reflected in their books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">NEW MACHAR AND DAVID HUME<br />1737-1751</span></h2>

<p>Soon after Reid’s return to Marischal College from his
English tour, the young librarian was presented, by the
professors of King’s College, to the pastoral charge of
New Machar, a parish some ten miles to the north-west
of Aberdeen. The fact that his kinsman, James Gregory,
was professor in King’s may perhaps explain this unwonted
exercise of patronage in favour of a graduate of the rival
College.</p>

<p>The presentation, at any rate, raised a storm of opposition
among the parishioners. It was the occasion of one of
those conflicts of Church parties to which the law of patronage
gave rise in Scotland in those days. The incidents of
Reid’s introduction to ecclesiastical office form a characteristic
picture. Rural prejudice was due in this case
to various circumstances. It was partly influenced by a
sermon, preached in the church of New Machar, on
February 10, 1737, at the moderation of the call, by
the Rev. John Bisset, one of the ministers of Aberdeen.
Mr. Bisset had himself been minister of the parish ten
years before. He was now a noted preacher in the North,
and one with whom express concurrence of the congregation
in an ecclesiastical settlement was a high article of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In his sermon he denounced aristocratic interference,
insinuated undue outside influence and personal
favour, claimed a right to a vote in the election of his
minister for every Christian, the poor man as much as
the rich, and concluded with an appeal to his audience
to quit themselves like men, and to trust in God. The
recent history of the parish strengthened this appeal. The
last presentation to New Machar was inauspicious. In
1729 a ‘riding committee’ had introduced Mr. Bisset’s
successor. Soon after, the new minister was accused of
‘powdering his wig on the Sabbath.’ Absolved by the
Church courts, he was in 1736 deposed for a graver offence.
It was a time of ecclesiastical anarchy in New Machar.
The record of the parish is blank between the minute
which tells of the departure of Mr. Bisset in 1728, and
that which registers ‘the ordination of Mr. Thomas Reid’
in May 1737.</p>

<p>Reid was the innocent victim of the sermon and the
scandal when he came to be ordained on May 12, 1737.
He had been violently attacked and maltreated by persons
in disguise, who, according to tradition, ducked him in a
horse-pond. It is also told that when he officiated for
the first time in the parish church, he was guarded in the
pulpit by a drawn sword.</p>

<p>For fifteen years New Machar manse was Reid’s
home. Popular prejudice was overcome by his mild,
beneficent activity. Those who had been carried into
outrage by hasty judgment at the beginning, followed
him on his departure with blessings and tears. ‘We
fought against Mr. Reid when he came,’ they are reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as saying, ‘and we would have fought for him when he
went away.’ His marriage, in August 1740, to his cousin
Elizabeth, a daughter of his London uncle, Dr. George
Reid, promoted this change. The gracious manner and
constant goodness of this companion of his life for more
than fifty years was long remembered in the Aberdeenshire
parish. Six daughters and three sons were the issue of the
marriage. Five daughters were born at New Machar, and
one died there. Reid’s family bible at Birkwood contains
the following interesting record in his handwriting:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Mr. Thomas Reid was born at Strachan, April 26, 1710;
married to Elizabeth Reid, August 12, 1740. The said Elizabeth
was born August 3, 1724. Their children:—(1) Jean,
born July 21, 1741, died February 27, 1772, buried in College
Churchyard, Glasgow; (2) Margaret, born October 20, 1742,
died 1772, buried as above; (3) Martha, born August 22,
1744, married Dr. Patrick Carmichael; (4) Elizabeth, born
February 21, 1746, died of smallpox in August 1746, buried in the
Churchyard of New Machar; (5) Anna, born July 10, 1751,
died of chin-cough May 21, 1753, buried in the Isle of Old
Machar; (6) George, born February 11, 1755, died at St.
John’s, Newfoundland, February 1780; (7) Lewis, born December
13, 1756, died of teething July 19, 1758, buried in the
Isle of Old Machar; (8) David, born February 26, 1762, died
at Edinburgh August 30, 1782; (9) Elizabeth, born May 8,
1766, died June 1, 1767, of smallpox by inoculation, buried
in the College Churchyard, Glasgow.’</p>

</div>

<p>The story of the fifteen years at New Machar, as we
have it, is almost empty of incidents, a dim picture.
The scene does not warmly touch the imagination. Undulating
hills of moderate size, chill and tame; land monotonously
fertile, with scanty timber; yet pleasant prospects
in the distance of the valley of the Don, with Benachie
and remoter Grampians in the background; a population
mostly agricultural; two or three country mansions; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
highroad from Aberdeen to Banff traversing the parish.
New Machar was wanting, on the whole, in the breezy
highland charm of the early home at Strachan. The
social life was simple but intellectually stagnant. Among
the infrequent visitors at the manse I find incidental
mention in Reid’s letters of one. He tells that he made the
acquaintance of the well-known Jacobite, Mr. Hepburn of
Keith, ‘by his lodging a night in my house at New Machar,’
when he was in the Prince’s army, on his way to Culloden;
perhaps when he was in Lord George Murray’s division,
which retreated through Aberdeenshire in February 1746,
or in one of the detachments which were in motion
around New Machar in the preceding December.</p>

<p>The Thomas Reid who is revealed to us in his books
does not promise pulpit eloquence likely to interest this
rustic population. Like Bishop Butler when he was in
his remote rectory at Stanhope a few years before, he
was pondering the chief intellectual work of his life in
exile from intellectual society. None of Reid’s sermons
are found among his manuscripts. Indeed, it appears that
his characteristic modesty and diffidence, combined, it is
said, with some neglect of literary culture in his early
education, induced him at first to read to his rustic audience
the sermons of eminent Anglican preachers, instead of compositions
of his own—thus adopting a practice afterwards
recommended by Paley, by which, with fit selection, many
audiences might benefit in this age of social pressure. ‘As
to preaching,’ says Paley, ‘if your situation requires a sermon
every Sunday, make one and find five.’ Tillotson and the
Nonconformist Evans are mentioned as Reid’s favourites,
and something is said about Samuel Clarke. The luminous
good sense of Tillotson, and the reverential temper of Evans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and the lucid reasoning of Clarke, would naturally attract
Reid. But emotion as well as moral ideal was not wanting
in his religious life. It is said that in a Communion Service
tears fell from his eyes when he enlarged on the divine
beauty of the character of Jesus. The following expression
of religious feeling during an illness of his young wife
appears among his manuscripts, dated March 30, 1746:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘O God, I desire humbly to supplicate Thy Divine Majesty
in behalf of my distressed wife, who is by Thy hand brought
very low, and in imminent danger of death, if Thou, who alone
doest wonders, do not in mercy interpose Thy almighty arm,
and bring her back from the gate of death. I deserve justly,
O Lord, that Thou shouldst deprive me of the greatest comfort
of my life, because I have not been so thankful to Thee as I
ought for giving me such a kind and affectionate wife. I have
forgot Thy goodness in bringing us happily together by an
unforeseen and undesigned train of events, and blessing us with
so much love and harmony of affection, and so many of the
comforts and conveniences of life. I have not been so careful
as I ought to have been to stir her up to piety and Christian
virtues. I have not taken that pains with my children and
servants and relatives as I ought. Alas! I have been too
negligent of my pastoral duty and my private devotions, too
much given to the pleasures and satisfactions of this world, and
too little influenced by the promises and the hope of a future
state. I have employed my studies, reading, and conversation
rather to please myself than to edify myself and others. I have
sinned greatly in neglecting many opportunities of making
private applications to my flock and family in the affairs of their
souls, and in using too slight preparation for my public exercises.
I have thrown away too much of my time in sloth and sleep,
and have not done so much for the relief of the poor and
destitute as I might have done. The means that Providence
has afforded me of correcting my evil inclinations I have abused
to pamper and feed them in various instances. For these and
many other sins which have escaped my memory Thou mightst
justly inflict so great a chastisement on me, as to make my
children motherless and deprive me of my dear wife. O Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
accept of my humble and penitent confession of these my
offences, which I desire to acknowledge with shame and sorrow,
and am resolved by Thy grace to amend. If Thou art pleased
to hearken to the voice of my supplications, and grant my
request on behalf of my dear wife in restoring her to health, I
do promise and covenant through grace to turn from these
backslidings, to express my thankfulness by a vigorous discharge
of my duty as a Christian, a minister, and master of a
family, and by an alms of ten pounds sterling to the poor in
meat and money. Lord, pardon if there is anything in this
presumptuous, or unbecoming a humble penitent sinner; and,
Lord, accept of what is sincerely designed as a new bond upon
my soul to my duty, through Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour.’</p>

</div>

<p>This fervid expression of devotion reveals an intensity
of purpose which worked beneath the outwardly placid and
discreet life. Mrs. Reid survived this critical illness for
nearly half a century.</p>

<p>Much of Reid’s time at New Machar, according to his
brother-in-law Mr. Rose, was spent in meditative thought,
with an attention to the activities of his own mind of which
few men are capable. Traditions of solitary walks immersed
in study were long in circulation. He found his
chief recreation, we are told, in the manse garden or in
botanical observations. His society attracted his neighbours.
With Sir Archibald Grant of Monymusk he maintained
a lifelong intimacy. He never forgot New Machar, and
long after, in times of distress, anonymous gifts were traced
to his thoughtful but modest beneficence.</p>

<p>Three years before Reid left New Machar, when he was
in his thirty-eighth year, he made his first appearance in
print, in a short paper contributed to the Royal Society,
which appeared in their <cite>Transactions</cite> in October 1748. It
is called ‘An Essay on Quantity.’ It was occasioned by a
book published more than twenty years before, the <cite>Inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</cite>, by
Francis Hutcheson, afterwards the celebrated Professor of
Moral Philosophy in Glasgow. In this tract simple and
compound ratios are applied, in forms of mathematical
reasoning, to solve problems of moral philosophy. It
illustrates in some degree the bent of Reid’s thoughts
at this time, and his inherited interest in mathematical
reasonings. But it also shows bent of thought in another
direction, and recognition of other scientific methods than
mathematical demonstration, which had been favoured as
of universal application by philosophers like Descartes
and Spinoza. Reid argued, in the spirit of his master
Turnbull, that genuine ethical inquiry is concerned with
a class of facts which are under a higher category, and
refuse to submit to geometrical measurement.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance in the evolution of philosophy
in Scotland that Reid’s first publication should thus
be adverse criticism of Hutcheson, the father of Modern
Philosophy in Scotland. It is also curious that this juvenile
performance presents another of the parallels between Reid
and Kant. For it happened that in the preceding year
Kant had made his first appearance, on a question concerned
with mathematics, and, like Reid’s, in an argument
against conclusions maintained by Leibnitz.</p>

<p>But this mathematical <i lang="fr">brochure</i> imperfectly represents the
‘intense study’ at New Machar. For an event happened soon
after Reid’s settlement there which determined the direction
of his thoughts for the remainder of his life. In January
1739, a book made an almost unnoticed appearance in
London, which in the end became the chief factor in
shaping the course of European thought. Its author was
David Hume, then a young man, unknown to fame, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thirty years of age, the younger son of a Berwickshire laird.
Hume was younger than Reid by one year: both were born
on the 26th of April. His name is popularly connected
with the <cite>History of England</cite>; but this <cite>Treatise of Human
Nature</cite>, which somehow found its way into the manse of
New Machar, represents his most significant work. It has
contributed perhaps as much as any single book to the
subsequent progress of philosophy in Europe. Hume
indeed penetrates into regions which the ordinary reader
fails to connect with everyday interests of life, or with the
hopes and fears of human beings. Accordingly, as he tells,
the <cite>Treatise</cite> ‘fell dead-born from the press, without attaining
such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the
zealots.’ In a letter to his friend Henry Home, afterwards
Lord Kames, written soon after this explosive mixture had
been applied, its author announces that the issue was ‘but
indifferent, if I may judge by the sale of the book, and if I
may believe my bookseller. I am now out of humour with
myself; but doubt not in a little time to be out of humour
with the world, like other unsuccessful authors. After all, I
am sensible of my folly in entertaining any discontent, much
more despair, on this account, since I could not expect any
better from such abstract reasoning.’ This book, which
professes to explain ‘human nature’ as a fact in the universe,
conducts to a final paralysis of human intelligence in
universal doubt.</p>

<p>This threatened paralysis awoke Reid into his characteristic
intellectual life. He was among the first in Europe
to see the far-reaching meaning of Hume’s account of man’s
condition. He found in it the deep-lying seeds of modern
agnosticism. Its rashness was confessed by its author. ‘I
acknowledge a very great mistake in conduct in publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
my <cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite>, a book which pretended to
innovate in all the sublimest parts of philosophy, and which
I composed before I was five-and-twenty. But what success
the same doctrines better illustrated and expressed may meet
with <i lang="la">adhuc sub judice lis est</i>. I wish I had always confined
myself to the more easy parts of erudition.’ Accordingly,
about ten years after, Hume presented his ‘sceptical doubts’
in a milder form, and accompanied by a ‘sceptical solution’
of them, in an <cite>Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding</cite>;
but it was Hume in the original <cite>Treatise</cite>, not as recast
in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, that moved Reid. Kant, like Reid, was
awakened from what he calls his ‘dogmatic slumber’ by
David Hume; but it was the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, not the <cite>Treatise</cite>, of
which last he appears ignorant, that roused Kant. Reid
grappled with the more open and all-pervading uncertainties
of the earlier work.</p>

<p>Let us look into the book which appalled the young
minister of New Machar by the spectre of a meaningless
universe and illusory human nature. Its author seemed
to be indulging in ‘a peculiar strain of humour when he
set out in his introduction by promising with a grave face
no less than a complete system of the sciences upon a
foundation entirely new, namely, human nature, while the
intention of the whole work is to show that there is neither
human nature nor science in the world. He surely believed,
against his principles, that he should be read, and that
he should retain his personal identity till he reaped the
reputation justly due to his metaphysical acumen.’ Reid
found him taking for granted as his fundamental maxim,
that nothing can be admitted as true which cannot be
logically deduced from impressions of sense. Hume found
the impressions of sense to be transitory, and distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in their succession by degrees of intensity,—sensations
when in their highest intensity, memories when in an
abated degree, and mere fancies when the intensity is
at a minimum. His maxim forbade recognition of more
reality in the universe than a momentary reality of isolated
perceptions, in their different degrees of intensity, but
without any reasonable retrospective memory, or any
reasonable expectation with its hopes or fears. What we
call ‘existence’ was resolved into an unintelligible chaos
of felt impressions—a purposeless procession, in which the
percipient loses his very selfhood and all besides. The
Past, the Distant, the Future, are all illusions. ‘Things’
and ‘persons’ are only unconnected transitory feelings,
without any permanent person to feel them. The word
‘identity’ is meaningless. A person cannot be more than
a momentary idea. ‘I never catch <em>self</em> except in the form
of a passing feeling.’ Present feeling alone exists.</p>

<p>It is impossible without contradiction to express a
philosophy which destroys intelligible expression; virtually
dismissing as absurdities all personal pronouns, all substantive
nouns, and all verbs; leaving abstract adjectives
as the only parts of speech;—and, as such adjectives are
really unintelligible, leaving us the speechless and motionless
victims of philosophical suicide. When I start with
the preliminary maxim of Hume, I literally lose ‘myself’
at last in a radically untrustworthy universe, or I find
myself suspended over a bottomless abyss. Here are the
last words of this intellectual suicide at the end of his
destructive analysis:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I am affrighted and confounded with the forlorn solitude in
which I am placed by my philosophy. When we trace up the
human understanding to its first principles, we find it to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
us into such sentiments as seem to turn into ridicule all our
past pains and industry, and to discourage us from all future
inquiries. Nothing is more curiously inquired after by the
mind of man than the <em>causes</em> of phenomena; nor are we content
with knowing the immediate causes, but push on our inquiries
till we arrive at the original and ultimate principle. This is
our aim in all our studies and reflections. And now we must
be disappointed when we learn that this tie lies merely in ourselves,
and is nothing but that determination which is acquired
by custom. Such a discovery not only cuts off all hope of ever
attaining satisfaction, but even prevents our very wishes; since
it appears that when we desire to know the ultimate and
operating principle or something which resides in the external
object, we only contradict ourselves, or talk without a meaning....
The intense view of these manifold contradictions and
imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me and
heated my brain, that I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning,
and can look at no opinion even as more probable or likely
than another. All who believe anything, on any subject, with
certainty, must be fools.’</p>

</div>

<p>This is the issue of the <cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite>
when the logical understanding is finally resolved into
transitory and isolated feelings, without permitted final
postulates of reason, in the form of faith or in any other
form, to connect and interpret them.</p>

<p>It was this issue that Reid took seriously. He set himself,
at first for his own satisfaction only, to consider the ground
he had for trusting experience, when Hume reported that
experience dissolved into sensational atoms. Accordingly
he spent much of his time at New Machar in reflecting
first of all on his perceptions through the senses. He
began with these, because it seemed that even as the
foundations of abstract mathematics lie in the mathematical
axioms and definitions, so the foundations of all
concrete reasoning are to be found in the rational constitution
of perception through the five senses. ‘In the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of human knowledge, perception is the root, common
understanding is the trunk, and the sciences are the
branches.’ Here is his own account of his state of
mind when he was engaged in these New Machar wrestlings:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘If my mind is indeed what the <cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite>
makes it, I find that I have been only in an enchanted castle,
when I seemed to be living in a well-ordered universe. I have
been imposed upon by spectres and apparitions. I blush
inwardly to think how I have been deluded. I am ashamed
of my frame, and can hardly forbear expostulating with my
destiny. I see myself, and the whole frame of Nature, shrink
into fleeting ideas, which, like Epicurus’s atoms, dance about
in emptiness. Descartes no sooner began to dig in this mine
than scepticism was ready to break in upon him. He did what
he could to keep it out. Malebranche and Locke, who dug
deeper, found the difficulty of keeping out the enemy still to
increase; but they laboured honestly in the design. Then
Berkeley, who carried on the work, despairing of securing all,
bethought himself of an expedient. By giving up the material
world, which he thought might be spared without loss, and even
with advantage, he hoped by an impregnable position to secure
the world of spirits. But, alas! the <cite>Treatise of Human
Nature</cite> wantonly sapped the foundation of this partition, and
drowned all in one universal deluge.’</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly forty years after he left New Machar, Reid says<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
that in early life he ‘believed the whole of Berkeley’s
system’—till Hume opened his eyes to ‘consequences’
that follow from the philosophy of Descartes and his
successors, ‘which gave me more uneasiness than the
want of a material world. So it came into my mind more
than forty years ago’ to question its foundation. Hume
accordingly made Reid revise critically the philosophy in
which he had been educated by George Turnbull. The
issue appeared after he left New Machar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Reid was now to be placed in a condition more favourable
to intense and persistent thought. On November 22,
1751, he was admitted to King’s College, Aberdeen, as
one of its regent masters, in succession to Mr. Alexander
Rait. The patronage was vested in the College, and the
minute which records his election suggests the reputation
which the rural pastor had now secured among the cultured
few, notwithstanding his modest and retired life.</p>

<p>It was not without reluctance that Reid left New Machar.
Ramsay of Ochtertyre, who knew him well, tells that when
the deputation from King’s College came to invite him to
become a regent, ‘he at first declined, explaining that he
desired to live in retirement till he should complete some
literary projects which engaged him. Mrs. Reid, however,
having discovered the errand of the visitors, urged her
husband to accept the offer, being less fond of retirement,
and having no objection to a better income and better
society. When her learned guests repeated their proposal
after dinner, she seconded them with such cogent arguments
that Mr. Reid was beat out of all his objections.’—<cite>Scotland

<p>Reid’s movement from New Machar to the academic home
opened for him in Old Aberdeen placed him and his young
family amidst surroundings that touch imagination by their
natural beauty and historic associations. For centuries the
College, founded by Bishop Elphinstone, and at first presided
over by Hector Boece, with its chapel and crowned tower,
in the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">old university town,</div>
<div class="verse">Between the Don and the Dee,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking over the grey sand dunes,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking out on the cold North Sea,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">has shed intellectual light over the North of Scotland,
especially among the Celts in the Highlands. At King’s
College one sees a miniature Oxford almost under the
shadow of the Grampians. Perhaps Reid’s temperament
was too prosaic to contemplate his new surroundings
with the sentiment which the city at the mouth of the
Don afterwards called forth in Thackeray, who, in ‘a
delightful tour in the north, was charmed with Inverness,
and fell in love with Old Aberdeen—an elderly decayed
mouldering old beauty who lives quietly on the seashore,
near her grand new granite sister of a city.’ The affectionate
recollection with which Sir James Mackintosh recalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
his student days at King’s College, and the companionship
there of Robert Hall, is another testimony to its charms.
The arena in which these two, called by their fellow-students
‘Plato and Herodotus,’ encountered one another most frequently
was in morals and metaphysics. ‘After having
sharpened their weapons by reading, they often repaired to
the spacious sands upon the seashore, and still more to
the picturesque scenery on the banks of the Don above the
old town and the Brig of Balgownie, to discuss with eagerness
the problems of existence. There was scarcely an
important position in Berkeley’s <cite>Minute Philosopher</cite>, in
Butler’s <cite>Analogy</cite>, or in <cite>Edwards on the Will</cite>, over which
they did not debate with the utmost intensity.’ From these
discussions in the environs of the ‘old university town,’
Mackintosh was wont to say that he ‘learned more than
from all the books he ever read.’</p>

<p>It was in the canonist’s manse, pleasantly placed nearly
in front of the College, immediately north of the Snow
Church, at the entrance to Powis House, that Reid found
himself in the winter of 1751.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was rented by him from
the University. The quaint manse, nestled among trees,
with its low thatched roof,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has disappeared, and with it
other picturesque old houses, which added charm to the
neighbourhood when Reid taught in King’s College nearly
a hundred and fifty years ago. The crown tower of the
College chapel rose almost in front of the manse, the rival of
St. Giles’s at Edinburgh and of St. Nicholas’s at Newcastle,
unique in Scottish academical architecture. Eastwards
in the quadrangle was the Hall in which the students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dined, a memorial of Bishop Elphinstone, and the dormitories
of the students, which were of later date. General
Monk’s tower stood in the eastern corner; behind the
Hall was the kitchen, and near it the College well, whence
the links stretched to the shore, ‘the grey sand dunes’ in
those days unbroken by tame streets and modern villas.</p>

<p class="tb">The professorial system of divided work, which assigns
special departments of learning to supposed experts, had
not superseded in King’s College the method of regency
which prevailed in the early history of all the universities of
Scotland. The regent was intrusted with the education
of his pupils from the first matriculation to graduation; or
when Latin, Greek, and pure mathematics were each provided
for professorially, regents in philosophy each taught
in successive sessions the various branches of natural and
physical science, and of moral and metaphysical philosophy.
This system was followed in all the Scottish universities
until last century. It was modified by the Commission
of 1690, which ordained that, besides a separate professor
of Latin, one of the four regents should profess Greek
only, and take charge of undergraduates in their first
year. By about the middle of the century ‘regenting’
was wholly abolished in four of the five Universities—in
Edinburgh in 1708, in Glasgow in 1727, in St. Andrews in
1747, and in Marischal College and University in 1753.
But in King’s College the various branches of Philosophy,
natural and moral, were still regented when Reid began
to teach. He was thus required to teach mathematics
and the sciences of matter, as well as psychology and moral
philosophy. He thus gave lectures on the philosophy of
mind only every third year. One of the other two years was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
given to natural history and the easier parts of physical
science; the second to mathematics and natural philosophy.</p>

<p>During 1751-52, which was his first session, Reid as
regent taught natural philosophy to undergraduates of the
third year; in the following winter the same students, in
their fourth year, were still in his charge. His full sequence,
accordingly, did not commence till 1753-54, when for the
first time he took the second class, consisting of those
beginning philosophical studies. So his successive three
years courses ran thus:—1753-56, 1756-59, 1759-62. In
the last year of each course, as ‘promoter,’ he presented
his undergraduates to receive the Master’s degree, and
also delivered a graduation thesis. His theses (still extant
in manuscript at Birkwood) were in Latin; they deal
chiefly with the methods and human conditions of philosophical
inquiry.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of Reid’s lectures at King’s College were in
this way concerned with natural history and applied mathematics:
only one-third was given to the central object of his
intellectual interest at New Machar. I have examined a
manuscript volume of notes of the lectures in ‘Natural
Philosophy’ which he gave in 1757-58. They comprehend,
after an introductory exposition of the province and
methods of physics, the laws of motion, astronomy, optics,
electricity, and hydrostatics. The notes show that Reid
was well abreast of the physical science of his time.</p>

<p>At the time of Reid’s appointment as a regent of philosophy
in King’s College, the alternative of regency or
professoriate was discussed in the University. He entered
readily into this and other questions of University reform,
and prevailed on his colleagues to make some important
changes. Largely through his influence the teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
session was extended from five to seven months; the
Humanity or Latin class was better organised; the
bursary endowments were redistributed for competition;
and in the order of undergraduate study, the sciences
concerned with the outward world were made to precede
psychology and ethics, which were reserved for the last
year, as more consistent with the development of the
human mind in its natural ascent from external observation
to reflection. An account of the changes was
published in 1754.</p>

<p>It is curious that it was through Reid’s influence that the
regency system was retained in King’s College, in preference
to the professorial, which, in order to secure division of
labour among the teachers, under the growth of knowledge,
had been already adopted in the other Universities. His
hand may be traced in the following statement of reasons
for this conservative policy:—‘Every professor of philosophy
in this University is also tutor to those who study under
him; and it seems to be generally agreed that it must be
detrimental to a student to change his every session. And
though it be allowed that a professor who has only one
branch of philosophy for his province may have more
leisure to make improvements in it for the benefit of the
learned world, yet it does not seem extravagant to suppose
that a [regent] professor ought to be sufficiently qualified
to teach all that his pupils can learn in philosophy
[natural and moral] in the course of three sessions.’
Half a century later the higher academical ideal implied in
a professoriate prevailed, according to which the professor
is responsible for promoting his branch of human knowledge,
as well as for the instruction of youth—in educating
influence more powerful, when he incites to study by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
vitality which original research is apt to communicate to
his lectures. The development of a university, it has been
remarked, is prompt and easy when each department of
its cyclopædia is separately taught by an able professor;
whereas a university which abandons instruction to regent-tutors
must be content not only to teach little, and that
little ill, but to continue to teach what is elsewhere obsolete
and exploded.</p>

<p>In a letter of Reid’s in 1755, an account is given of
the reformed, if somewhat officious, academical discipline
which then prevailed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The students here,’ he says, ‘have lately been compelled to
live within the College. We need but look out at our windows
to see when they rise and when they go to bed. They are seen
nine or ten times throughout the day statedly, by one or other
of the Masters—at public prayers, school-hours, meals, in their
rooms, besides occasional visits which we can make with little
trouble to ourselves. They are shut up within walls at nine at
night. This discipline hath indeed taken some pains and
resolution, as well as some expense, to establish it. The board
of the first table is 50 marks per quarter, <i>i.e.</i> 54s. 2d., and
the second 40. The rent of a room is from 7 shillings to
20 shillings in the session. There is no furniture in their
rooms but a bedstead, tables, chimney-grate, and fender;
the rest they must buy for themselves. All other perquisites
from 12 to 17 shillings.’</p>

</div>

<p>This discipline was more or less in vogue during
the remainder of last century. Nearly twenty years after
the date of Reid’s letter, when Johnson and Boswell
visited Aberdeen, Johnson says that ‘in King’s College
there is kept a public table, but the scholars in the Marischal
College are boarded in the town.’ ‘The abandonment of
this custom,’ Mr. Rait tells us, ‘seems to have been a
gradual process, and to have taken place during the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
quarter of the nineteenth century. The restraint of collegiate
residence had become exceedingly irksome.’ With
the increasing age of entrants, schoolboy discipline might
seem less expedient.</p>

<p>Instruction in the art of dancing was, it seems, provided
by the University under the reformed regulations, to add
manly grace to the rude bodily vigour of the Scottish undergraduate.
Reid in advocating this may have remembered
Locke’s advice in his <cite>Thoughts on Education</cite>: ‘Dancing
being that which gives graceful motions all the life, and
above all things manliness and a becoming confidence, I
think it cannot be learned too early. But you must be
sure to have a good master, that knows and can teach what
is graceful and becoming, and that gives a freedom and ease
to all the motions of the body. One that teaches not this
is worse than none at all.’ How long this civilising art
was cultivated in Reid’s College I have not discovered.</p>

<p>In Aberdeen Reid found himself in the society of persons
of more than provincial eminence, destined, indeed, to leave
their mark on the thought and literature of Scotland. The
Chair of Medicine in his College was occupied by his
cousin, Dr. John Gregory, a successful observer of external
nature and man. In Marischal College, Thomas Blackwell,
the Professor of Greek when Reid was an undergraduate,
was now Principal; soon followed by George Campbell,
who became the philosophical theologian of the Church of
Scotland, by his criticism of Hume’s reasoning about
miracles, and a master in literary, biblical, and ecclesiastical
criticism,—in his <cite>Philosophy of Rhetoric</cite>, his Translation of
the Gospels, and his History of the development of the
Christian Church. Campbell was nine years younger than
Reid, like him an alumnus of Marischal College; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
been minister of Banchory-Ternan for nine years before he
was called to Aberdeen. He rivalled Reid himself in
analytic power and calm, candid, luminous reasoning.
Alexander Gerard, like Reid, a University reformer, and
author of essays on ‘Taste’ and on ‘Genius,’ was Professor of
Philosophy in Marischal College, and then of Divinity there,
and afterwards at King’s. There was William Duncan, too,
whose <cite>Logic</cite> was for a time in vogue in Scottish Universities—a
regent in Marischal College when Reid began to teach
philosophy at King’s; and Reid’s lifelong friend Stewart
was still in the Chair of Mathematics. Perhaps the most
widely known Aberdonian when he lived was James Beattie,
poet more than philosopher, Professor of Logic and Moral
Philosophy in Marischal College, whose essay on ‘Truth’
gave him a name in the intellectual world, while the grace
and pathos of the ‘Minstrel’ and the ‘Hermit’ appealed
to a wider class, and secured a popular reputation. Aberdeen
and its neighbourhood were then the home also of
accomplished physicians and naturalists and scholars—Skenes
and Ogilvies, Dunbars and Gordons.</p>

<p>As I have said, Reid’s first years at King’s College were
much given to academical reform. His later years there
were distinguished by his connection with a Society for
philosophical inquiry, then quickened in Scotland by the
fashionable scepticism of David Hume. Reid and Gregory
originated this ‘Aberdeen Philosophical Society,’ or ‘Wise
Club,’ as it was called. It was the parent of some of the
most remarkable books in Scottish philosophical literature
in the latter part of last century. The first meeting was on
January 12, 1758, and the last was in February 1773. The
original members were Dr. John Gregory, Dr. David Skene,
Professor John Stewart, Mr. Robert Trail, the Rev. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Campbell, and Mr. Thomas Reid; to whom in the same
year were added the Rev. Alexander Gerard, the Rev.
John Farquhar, Mr. Charles Gordon, and Mr. John Kerr.
James Beattie joined them in 1760, Dr. George Skene and
Mr. William Ogilvie in 1763, Mr. James Dunbar in 1765,
and Mr. William Trail in 1766. Reid was secretary of
the Society, and the minutes for many years are in his
handwriting. It met once a fortnight on the second and
fourth Wednesdays of each month. ‘The members,’ Sir
W. Forbes tells us in his <cite>Life of Beattie</cite>, ‘met at five o’clock
in the evening—for in those days at Aberdeen it was the
custom to dine early—when one of the members, as president,
took the chair, and left it at half an hour after eight,
when they partook of a slight and inexpensive collation,
and at ten o’clock they separated.’ At these meetings it
appears that part of the evening’s entertainment was the
reading of a short essay, composed by one of the members
in his turn. Besides these discourses, a literary or philosophical
question was proposed each night, for discussion at
the next meeting. And it was the duty of the proposer of
the question to open the discussion; by him, also, the
opinions of the members who took a part in it were digested
into an abstract, which was engrossed in the album of
the Society. I am told that the <i>Lion Inn</i>, on the Spital
Hill near Reid’s manse, and sometimes the <i>Lemon Tree
Inn</i>, in the new town, were the usual places of meeting.
The common attendance was five or six. One of the
rules enjoined moderation and forbade toasts.</p>

<p>The meetings were given partly to essays by the members,
and partly to oral discussions of proposed questions. ‘Philosophy,’
according to the rules, ‘comprehends every principle
of science which may be deduced by just or lawful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
induction from the phenomena either of the human mind
or of the material world.’ Perhaps no society of the kind in
this country has fulfilled its end so well. The ‘Rankenian
Club’ and the ‘Select Society’ in Edinburgh lasted longer,
or enrolled more members, but neither of them was the
parent of so much good literature. The ‘Inquiry’ of Reid,
Beattie’s essay on ‘Truth,’ Gerard on ‘Taste’ and on
‘Genius,’ and Campbell’s books on ‘Miracles’ and on
‘Rhetoric’ appear in fragments or in germ in the minutes
of the ‘Wise Club’ of Aberdeen. Its vitality was sustained
and stimulated by the sceptical speculations of Hume,
which were much in touch with educated opinion in the
third quarter of last century, when spiritual philosophy was
languid in Britain and throughout the world. The tone
of those engaged in the philosophical vindication of belief
appears in one of Reid’s letters, who writes thus to David
Hume in 1763:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Your friendly adversaries, Drs. Campbell and Gerard, as
well as Dr. Gregory, return their compliments to you respectfully.
A little Philosophical Society here, of which all three
are members, is much indebted to you for its entertainment.
Your company, although we are all good Christians, would be
more acceptable than that of Athanasius; and since we cannot
have you upon the bench, you are brought oftener than any
other man to the bar; accused and defended with great zeal,
but without bitterness. If you write no more in morals, politics,
and metaphysics, I am afraid we shall be at a loss for subjects.’</p>

</div>

<p>It is interesting to find in the records of the Society
the subjects of the dissertations contributed by Reid during
the six years in which he was its mainspring,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as well as
the questions which he proposed for debate. They signally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
illustrate the course of his thoughts in these years. On May
24, 1758, ‘Mr. Reid intimat that he designed as the subject
of his discourse some Observations on the Philosophy of
the Mind, and particularly on the Perceptions we have by
Sight.’ On June 17, 1758, he read a paper ‘On the Difficulty
of a just Philosophy of the Human Mind; General
Prejudices against D——d (<i>sic</i>) Hume’s System of the
Mind; and some Observations on the Perceptions we have
by Sight.’ On March 14, 1759, he presented an ‘Analysis of
the Sensations of Smell and Taste.’ On 26th February 1760
‘Mr. Reid intimat that in his discourse he was to continue
his Analysis of the Senses’; and accordingly, on the 20th of
August in the same year, he gave notice of his intention of
‘taking Dr. Gregory’s place and reading a paper on the
Sense of Touch.’ In July 1761 he appears with a paper on
the ‘Transit of Venus’ in that year; and on the 26th
January 1762 he gives a ‘Valedictory Address,’ as first
annual president of the Society (the members having
previously taken the chair by rotation)—on ‘Euclid’s Definitions
and Axioms,’ in which he returns to the favourite
studies of his youth. In 1761 he had resumed his investigation
of the Senses, for in September he is credited with
another paper on the ‘Sense of Seeing.’ His last contribution,
in October 1762, was on ‘Perception,’ which summed
up his characteristic work in the Society. And after reading
this paper, ‘Mr. Reid declined to give it for insertion in the
Records, in regard that he proposed soon to send it to the
press, along with some other discourses which he had read
before the Society.’ A minute on 28th October 1764
announces that, ‘as Dr. Reid has left this country, no discourse
is to be expected from him.’</p>

<p>The following Questions for debate were proposed by Reid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
during the six years of his membership:—1758, 13th and
26th July, ‘Are the Objects of the Human Mind properly
divided into Impressions and Ideas; and must every Idea
be a copy of a preceding Impression?’ This closely
touches the fundamental assumption of the sceptical philosophy.
Those which follow suggest a disposition to ethical
and social discussion. 12th June 1759, ‘Whether Mankind
with regard to Morals always was and is the same?’ 1st
April 1760, ‘Whether it is proper to educate Children without
instilling Principles into them of any kind whatever?’
(Beattie’s celebrated experiment in the education of his son
may be connected with this.) 15th April 1761, ‘Whether
Moral Character consists in Affections in which the Will is
not concerned, or in fixed, habitual, and constant Purposes?’
8th January 1762, ‘Whether by the encouragement
of proper Laws the Number of Births in Great Britain
might be nearly doubled, or at least greatly increased?’
Here we have a sort of inverted Malthusianism suggested.
22nd November 1763, ‘Whether every Action deserving
Moral Approbation must be done from a persuasion of its
being morally good?’</p>

<p>Beattie, in one of his letters to Sir W. Forbes, thus
refers to the Society and to his own philosophical relation
to Reid:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I have of late been much engaged in metaphysics; at least,
I have been labouring with all my might to overturn that
visionary science. I am a member of a club in this town who
style themselves the Philosophical Society. I hope you will
not think the worse of this Society when I tell you, that to it
the world is indebted for a <cite>Comparative View of the Faculties
of Man</cite>, and an <cite>Inquiry into Human Nature on the Principles
of Common Sense</cite>. I have shown that all genuine
reasoning does ultimately terminate in principles which it is
impossible to disbelieve, and as impossible to prove; that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
therefore, the ultimate standard of truth to us is Common
Sense, or that instinctive conviction into which all true reasoning
does resolve itself; that therefore what contradicts Common
Sense is in itself absurd, however subtle the arguments which
support it. My principles in the main are not essentially
different from Dr. Reid’s; but they seem to offer a more compendious
method of destroying scepticism. I intend to show
(and have already in part shown) that all sophistical reasoning
is marked by certain characters which distinguish it from true
investigation; and thus I flatter myself I shall be able to
discover a method of detecting sophistry, even when one is not
able to give a logical confutation of its arguments.’</p>

</div>

<p>Beattie argued more in the temper of a partisan than
Reid, who criticised Hume in the spirit of a free and
candid inquirer after truth.</p>

<p>On the 18th of January 1762 the honorary Doctorate of
Divinity was conferred on Reid by Marischal College.</p>

<p>His fame was now more than local. In December 1763
he accepted the invitation of the University of Glasgow
to fill the Chair of Moral Philosophy which Adam Smith
had resigned. Before he entered on this new career he
had given to the world an <cite>Inquiry into the Human Mind
on the Principles of Common Sense</cite>. This classic work
embodies the result of twenty years of steady reflection
at New Machar and Aberdeen, in quest of the actual
foundation of human knowledge. Before we follow him
to Glasgow, we must examine this issue of his intellectual
life in Aberdeenshire—due to the challenge of modern
agnosticism in the person of David Hume.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">UNIVERSAL SCEPTICISM VERSUS INSPIRED COMMON SENSE:
AN ‘INQUIRY INTO THE HUMAN MIND ON THE
PRINCIPLES OF COMMON SENSE’<br />1764</span></h2>

<p>As early as October 1762, as we have seen, Reid had given
signs of an intention to offer the world some results of his
meditations regarding the foundations of belief. Accordingly,
in the end of the following year, he produced his
first book, <cite>An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles
of Common Sense</cite>. Its motto expresses its leading
argument—‘The inspiration of the Almighty giveth them
understanding.’ For it was to the inspirations, or revelations,
of what he called the ‘common sense’ or ‘common
judgment,’ regarded as the root of any human understanding
of man and his environment, that he made his
final appeal against the all-embracing doubt of Hume.
This was the rock on which he took his stand in the
universal deluge.</p>

<p>Reid was now in his fifty-fourth year. Hitherto his
modesty had concealed his strength from all but a few
friends. His book was concerned with questions that were
not likely to withdraw him rapidly from ‘the obscurity of
a learned retirement.’ The <cite>Inquiry</cite>, with its appeal to the
final reason latent in human nature, is not to be interpreted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
as an appeal to popular opinion against theories of philosophers.
In fact, its implied argument is not obvious to
popular intelligence, although it is profoundly connected
with all the chief interests of human life. Great books of
this sort attract only the few who think. His brother-in-law,
Mr. Rose, mentions that ‘Alexander Millar, the
London bookseller, being in Aberdeen at this time, and in
company with Dr. Reid, protested against books in metaphysics
as bad bargains for publishers; by which he said he
had himself lost money, but never gained any. Notwithstanding,
Dr. Reid, having his <cite>Inquiry</cite> ready for publication,
sold it to Mr. Millar for £50. When his friends bantered
him upon the small sum he had received for so valuable a
performance, he jocosely replied, “I think it is well sold.”’<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Another parallel here occurs between Reid and Kant.
The <cite>Kritik of Pure Reason</cite>, Kant’s first great work,
appeared in 1781, when he was in his fifty-seventh year.
So, too, with Locke, who inaugurated the era of modern
thought in which Reid and Kant are chief figures. His
<cite>Essay</cite>, like Reid’s <cite>Inquiry</cite>, was the first fruit of twenty
years of reflective thought, and it too made its appearance
when its author was in his fifty-seventh year. It is curious
to contrast the balanced caution and moderation of these
long pondered treatises with the more paradoxical productions
of others, whose intellectual ardour and impatience
speedily committed them to all-comprehensive systems.
Descartes, at forty, with his provisional doubt and reconstruction
on a slender foundation; Spinoza, younger still,
with his rational evolution of the universe from a single
substance; Berkeley with his analysis of the material world
into significant ideas, delivered at the age of twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with the impetuous enthusiasm of Irish juvenile genius;
and David Hume with his universal disintegration of
human knowledge and belief, planned before he was
one-and-twenty, composed before he was twenty-five, and
eagerly given to the world in his twenty-eighth year. Reid,
with his ‘good and well-wearing parts,’ characteristically
represents the restrained authorship of those who treat our
short life on this planet as short enough for well-weighed
answers to the final questions about life and the universe.</p>

<p>As Reid’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> was really an appeal to human nature
in arrest of Hume’s intellectual suicide, he desired, before
presenting it to the world, to submit the argument privately
to the Edinburgh sceptic. This was done through their
common friend Dr. Blair. After Hume had read portions
of the manuscript, he wrote this courteous letter to Reid
on Feb. 25, 1763:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘By Dr. Blair’s means I have been favoured with the perusal
of your performance, which I have read with great pleasure
and attention. It is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply
philosophical is wrote with so much spirit, and affords so much
entertainment to the reader, though I must still regret the disadvantages
under which I read it, as I never had the whole
performance at once before me, and could not be able to compare
one part with another. To this reason chiefly I ascribe
some obscurities which, in spite of your short analysis and
abstract, seem to hang over your system; for I must do you
the justice to own that when I enter into your ideas, no man
appears to express himself with greater perspicuity than you do,
a talent which above all others is requisite in that species of
literature which you have cultivated. There are some objections
which I would willingly propose to the chapter “Of Sight,”
did I not suspect that they arise from my not sufficiently
understanding it. I shall therefore forbear till the whole can
lie before me, and shall not at present propose any further
difficulties to your reasonings. I shall only say that if you
have been able to clear up these abstruse and important subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
instead of being mortified, I shall be so vain as to pretend
to a share of the praise; and shall think that my errors, by
having at least some coherence, have led you to make a more
strict review of my principles, which were the common ones,
and to perceive their futility.’</p>

</div>

<p>In his reply to this letter Reid recognises the debt which
philosophy owes to the sceptical criticism of Hume. He
writes thus to Hume:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">‘<span class="smcap">King’s College</span>, <i>18th March 1763</i>.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—On Monday last Mr. John Farquhar brought me
your letter of February 25th, enclosed in one from Dr. Blair.
I thought myself very happy in having the means of obtaining,
at second hand, through the friendship of Dr. Blair, your opinion
of my performance; and you have been pleased to communicate
it directly in so polite and friendly a manner as merits great
acknowledgments on my part.</p>

<p>‘In attempting to throw some light on these abstruse subjects,
I wish to preserve the due mean between confidence and
despair. But whether I have any success in this attempt or
not, I shall always avow myself your disciple in metaphysics.
I have learned more from your writings in this kind than from
all others put together. Your system appears to me not only
coherent in all its parts, but likewise justly deduced from
principles commonly received among philosophers,—principles
which I never thought of calling in question, until the conclusions
you draw from them in the <cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite>
made me suspect them. If these principles are solid your
system must stand; and whether they are or not can better be
judged after you have brought to light the whole system that
grows out of them, than when the greater part of it was wrapped
up in clouds and darkness. I agree with you therefore, that if
this system shall ever be demolished, you have a just claim
to a great share of the praise, both because you have made it
a distinct and determinate mark to be aimed at, and have
furnished proper artillery for the purpose. When you have
seen the whole of my performance, I shall take it as a very great
favour to have your opinion upon it, from which I make no
doubt of receiving light, whether I receive conviction or no.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Hume’s philosophy being the suicide of intelligence, can
hardly be spoken of as a ‘system.’ It is not constructive,
but wholly destructive, and therefore a negation of system,
philosophic or other, in a finally speechless and motionless
agnostic doubt.</p>

<p>Hume’s letter to Reid was his only rejoinder to the
<cite>Inquiry</cite>. In 1763 he had ceased to produce philosophical
books. His recognition of the ‘deeply philosophical’
nature of Reid’s argument is a testimony to the worth of
the work on which Reid’s literary reputation chiefly
rests. The ‘share of the praise’ which Hume claims,
Reid was ready to concede. ‘I hope,’ he says in the
Dedication of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, ‘I hope that the author of
this sceptical system wrote it in the belief that it would be
useful to mankind. And perhaps it may prove so at last.
For I conceive the sceptical writers to be a set of men
whose business it is to pick holes in the fabric of knowledge
wherever it is weak and faulty; and when those
places are properly repaired, the whole building becomes
more firm and solid than it was formerly’. And, in fact, the
intellectual progress of mankind has been sustained by an
alternation of sceptical and conservative philosophies.</p>

<p>After prolonged cogitation, the ‘weak and faulty’ place in
the ‘fabric’ of modern philosophy seemed to Reid to lie in
an unproved assumption with which modern philosophers
set out in their speculations. For they took for granted
that only the sensations and ideas within each mind could
be perceived: yet we naturally ‘believe that we are seeing
and handling the very outward things themselves’ that
make what is called the material world. If the philosophers
are right, we have no immediate revelation of
the qualities of outward things, and no evidence of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
existence, except the succession of changing sensations
and ideas of sensations which alone are presented to us.
I can never directly encounter an external object. What
I suppose to be outward is all in my mind. With a world
thus imprisoned within me, is there any legitimate way
through which I can assure myself of realities outside my
mind, including other living persons who have their own
sensations and ideas as much as I have mine, but numerically
different from my private stock? If not, grave consequences
seemed to follow: faith and hope must die out
of human life. So Reid argued.</p>

<p>The <cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite> was the scarecrow that
warned Reid of the destructive consequences of this assumption,
that we are shut up among our own ideas; as he
had himself in youth been taught to believe, and by which
he had been led on to Berkeley’s conception of a wholly ideal
material world. He now began to see this ideal material
world of Berkeley in a new light. It seemed to leave him
<em>alone</em> in the universe of his own mind. The ideal matter
of Berkeley cannot, he argued, inform me of the existence
of other living persons: what I have supposed to be other
persons must be, like the rest, only some of my own ideas.
If I allow that my own sensations and ideas are my only
possible original data, I cannot from such transitory phantoms
infer the real existence of other persons. With this
starting-point as my only one, the whole universe naturally
supposed to surround me—bodies and spirits, friends and
relations, all dead things and all living persons—acknowledged
by common judgment to have a permanent existence,
whether I am having ideas of them or not—vanish at once.
My <em>private</em> sensations and ideas can never really signify
to me the existence of other conscious beings; only what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
might be called <em>public ideas</em>, common to other minds and
to me, could do this. And such objects are not properly
called ‘ideas’—public or private; they are dead things and
living persons; they exist whether I individually have sensations
and ideas or not. In short, Reid could find nothing in
Berkeley’s philosophical theory—as he interpreted it<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—which
afforded even probable ground for concluding that there
were in existence other intelligent beings—fathers, brothers,
friends, or fellow-citizens. ‘I am left alone,’ the only
creature of God, in that forlorn state of egoism into which
it was said some of the disciples of Descartes were brought
by this same preliminary assumption of their master—a
sufficient <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> of the favourite postulate
which leads to it. To act upon it would argue insanity
in the agent; it must therefore be empty verbal speculation.
So Reid further argued.</p>

<p>But even this solitude is not the last issue of Reid’s
<i lang="fr">bête noire</i>. The system in which I have been educated,
he said, not only leaves me absolutely alone; <em>it extinguishes
me</em>, along with the external universe of things and persons;
it is at last literally suicidal. It transforms persistent
personal existence into a mere succession of unconnected
sensations and ideas. If the magic circle of sensations and
ideas, within a self that persists amidst perpetual changes,
cannot be broken through, then even this supposed ‘self’
must be an illusion, and the word self must be meaningless.
The personal pronoun ‘I,’ as well as the personal pronoun
‘you,’ are both alike unmeaning. The universe resolves at
last, not merely into sensations that are all referable to
myself, but into sensations without any self—into isolated
sensations—which seem indeed to follow one another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
an orderly way, but without any guarantee that the seeming
order is more than transitory, or that the illusory cosmos
may not at any moment become chaos.</p>

<p>Is there nothing within the resources of reason to arrest
this intellectual suicide? Has reason got anything to show
in justification of this preliminary sacrifice of a conviction
on which men have to act, whatever their theories may be?
Must I surrender the conviction, that when I am seeing
or touching I am actually having revealed to me something
that is extended and solid, and that, <em>as such, must</em> be
more and other than the private sensations and ideas of
the person that is seeing and touching? Must this conviction,
and others like it, on which human experience
practically depends, be all sacrificed on the altar of authority
and conjecture?</p>

<p>This had been the question around which Reid’s thoughts
were revolving in the twenty years preceding the publication
of his book. ‘For my own satisfaction,’ he tells us, ‘I
entered into a serious examination of the principles upon
which this sceptical system is built; and was not a little
surprised to find that it leans with its whole weight upon
a hypothesis which is ancient indeed, and hath been very
generally received by philosophers, but of which I could
find no solid proof. The hypothesis I mean is—that we
do not really perceive things that are external, but only
certain images and pictures of them imprinted upon the
mind, which are called “impressions” and “ideas.” I
thought it unreasonable, upon the authority of philosophers,
to admit an hypothesis which, in my opinion, overturns
all philosophy; all religion and virtue, and all common
sense; and I resolved to inquire into this subject anew,
without regard to any hypothesis.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>To <em>accept</em> as a spiritual fact the judgment of human
nature, which assures me that when I am seeing or
touching I am ‘face to face’ with a reality that exists
independently of my changing sensations or ideas, instead
of trying in vain by reasoning to <em>prove</em> the existence of this
reality by means of intervening sensations and ideas,—this
was the alternative he adopted. I dismiss the unwarranted
supposition that only my own mind and its invisible
contents can be immediately manifested to me; and
I fall back on the perception I have of something solid
and extended, and therefore more and other than a mere
sensation or idea, as what is present to me when I see
and touch. Recognition of the fact that our five senses
somehow bring us into a consciousness of what is neither a
transitory sensation nor an idea of a sensation, but something
independent of me, and that would continue to
exist after I individually had ceased to exist—this recognition
of external realities is Reid’s key to sound philosophy.
It is a displacement of the so-called ‘ideas’ of
the philosophers, and of fallacious inferences founded
upon them, and a substitution of the common reasonable
sense, or common judgment of reason, which neither
requires nor admits of logical proof. Reid might say that
what is most worth proving cannot be logically proved.
We all have a direct perception of external reality
which cannot be eradicated by reasoning. Abolition of
the prejudice which interposed <em>reasonings founded on unreal
ideas</em> between our perception and the solid and extended
reality, seemed to Reid, in virtue of its far-reaching
consequences, to be the chief good he had as a philosopher
secured to mankind. In his old age he writes thus to
Dr. Gregory:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The merit of what you are pleased to call <em>my philosophy</em>
lies, I think, chiefly in having called in question the common
theory of ideas, or images of things in the mind, being the
only objects of thought—a theory founded on natural prejudices,
and so universally received as to be interwoven with the
structure of language. Yet, were I to give you a detail of
what led me to call in question this theory, after I had long
held it as self-evident and unquestionable, you would think, as
I do, that there was much of chance in the matter. The discovery
was the birth of time, not of genius; and Berkeley and
Hume did more to bring it to light than the man that hit upon
it. I think there is hardly anything that can be called <em>mine</em>
in the philosophy of mind which does not follow with ease from
the detection of this prejudice.’</p>

</div>

<p>Yet Reid’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> has been condemned as an unphilosophical
appeal from the thoughtful to vulgar intelligence,
making the unreflecting many supreme judges
in questions intelligible only to the reflecting few. His
employment of ‘common sense’ to express the regulative
principle of his philosophy would put his book outside
philosophical literature, if this term were taken as a
synonym for unreasoned opinion—the average judgments
of the man in the street. Reid’s own account of what
he means by common sense, not to speak of Hume’s
recognition of the ‘deeply philosophical’ character of the
argument in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, should protect him against this
imputation. He describes the common sense to which he
constantly appeals as ‘the first degree of reason,’ and as
having for its office ‘to judge of things self-evident.’ As
such, he contrasts it with reasoning, or ‘the second degree
of reason, which draws conclusions that are not self-evident
from the self-evident judgments of the common
sense.’ This distinction between the common rational
sense, on which a knowledge of the universe, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
human, which falls short of omniscience, <em>must</em> ultimately
turn, and those judgments that are reached by logical
reasoning, corresponds to what the Greeks distinguished
as noetic and dianoetic power of reason in man. Reid’s
genuine judgments of the common sense may be regarded
as the divinely inspired response to questions which can
be determined for man only by this ideal man latent in
us all—judgments verified by the insanity that is implied
in resisting them in our actions.</p>

<p>As obtrusive examples of judgments of the common
sense, Reid takes the logically undemonstrable convictions
(1) of the existence of things external to and independent
of me and my perceptions; (2) of my individual personal
existence, and continuous personal identity; and (3) of
the uniformity, and therefore interpretability, of nature,
implying that I may form conclusions about what I have
not experienced by what I have experienced. I cannot
demonstrate the truth of these judgments: I can only
justify them in reason by showing that human nature
responds to them, and forbids me to reject them in my
actions, on pain of being judged a lunatic, whatever I may
say in my speculative theories. ‘Such original and natural
judgments,’ he says, ‘are part of the furniture which <em>nature</em>
hath given to the human understanding. They are the
inspiration of the Almighty. They serve to direct us in
the common affairs of life, when our reasoning faculty
would leave us in the dark; they are part of our constitution;
all the discoveries of our reason are grounded
upon them; they make up what is called <em>the common sense</em>
of mankind. A remarkable deviation from them, arising
from a disorder in the constitution, is what we call <em>lunacy</em>,
as when a man believes that he is made of glass. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a man suffers himself to be reasoned out of the principles
of common sense by metaphysical arguments, we call it
<em>metaphysical lunacy</em>, which differs from the other species
of the distemper in this, that it is not continued, but intermittent;
it is apt to seize the patient in solitary and
speculative moments; but when he enters into sanity,
Common Sense recovers her authority.’</p>

<p>It is the first of these three examples of the common
sense that is the subject of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>—intended
as preliminary to others which may follow. ‘A clear
enumeration and explication of the principles of common
sense’ was henceforward Reid’s ultimate aim; but thus far
he took those involved in our experience when we are
tasting, or smelling, or hearing, or touching, or seeing.
As axioms and definitions are the preliminaries of abstract
mathematical reasonings, so our sensuous perceptions
through the five senses are the preliminaries to reasonings
about concrete realities in the world of change. The
leading principle of the <cite>Inquiry</cite> is, that something extended,
solid, and movable is directly manifested in our
sensuous experiences, equally with the direct manifestations
of our own sensations and other feelings when we are
conscious of them; and also that we are obliged by
common sense to regard extended, solid, and movable
things as <em>other</em> than mere transitory sensation or idea.
Extended things, large or small, refuse to be melted down
into sensations or states of one’s private consciousness.
Take this specimen of philosophical argument for accepting
perceptions which cannot be logically demonstrated, but
which the common sense of human nature refuses to reject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Suppose I am pricked with a pin, I ask, is the <em>pain</em> I feel a
sensation? Undoubtedly it is. There can be nothing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
resembles pain in an inanimate thing: the pain must be in me,
a living being. But I ask again, is the <em>pin</em> a sensation? To
this question I feel myself under a necessity of answering that
the pin is not a sensation, nor can have the least resemblance
to any sensation. The pin has length and thickness, figure
and weight. A sensation can have none of these qualities. I
am not more certain that the pain I feel <em>is</em> a sensation than
that the pin <em>is not</em> a sensation. Yet the pin is an object of sense;
and I am as certain that I perceive its figure and hardness by
my senses as that I feel pain when I am pricked by it.’</p>

</div>

<p>This is to say that if, with the philosophers, I <em>call</em> the
pin as well as the pain a sensation or an idea, I must
mean by ‘sensation’ and ‘idea,’ when I apply those words
to the pin, not a private self-contained feeling or a fancy,
in which I am only manifesting my conscious self, but (so
to speak) a <em>public</em> sensation or idea—perceivable by other
persons as well as by me—a manifestation, in short, of what
is <em>outside my mind</em>—of something that exists permanently in
<em>space</em> and not transitorily in <em>me</em>—and that is thus fit to be a
medium of communication between me and other living persons,
informing me of their existence and in some measure
of their thoughts—all which (Reid takes for granted)
each person’s private feelings and fancies could not do.
But to employ the words ‘sensation’ and ‘idea’ in this
new meaning, and to speak of an idea as public or external,
would be an abuse of language. We must mark, always
by appropriate words, distinctions which we are obliged to
acknowledge in fact. The inspirations or revelations of the
common sense, in and through which the Almighty Power
gives us an understanding of the life and world in which
we find ourselves, inspirations in which all men are believed
more or less to participate, require us to distinguish the
solid and extended pin, as something public or outward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in contrast to the private feeling of pain, of which no one
except the person who feels it is conscious. I am thus
obliged to recognise more in existence than my own sensations
and ideas—as much obliged as I am to recognise my
sensations and ideas themselves when I am conscious of
them. Only so can I find myself living in an environment
that is capable of signifying the contemporaneous life, and
some of the thoughts and feelings of other persons. In
all this I am only falling back on the divine revelations of
the common sense. They make me reject in conduct what
is inconsistent with them; although this natural obligation
is all the reason I can give in justification of my obedience.</p>

<p>It is thus that Reid recognises his right in reason to grasp
realities that are independent of his individual self; and he
thinks that he is doing this philosophically by getting rid
of the unphilosophical supposition, that he needs to work
his way to them by logical reasoning, founded on wholly
inward impressions. The true philosophy of perception
with him is to discharge the medium, and at once take
the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>Some may think that the <cite>Inquiry</cite> represents wasted
labour—that the ‘metaphysical lunacy’ which abolishes
personal pronouns as meaningless words, and inconsistently
reasons that all who reason must be fools, is at the best
the idle intellectual pastime of persons who pretend to be
universal sceptics—all which Reid has taken too seriously,
and which at any rate by its self-contradiction refutes itself.
For it asserts that assertion is impossible. It is an argument
that concludes for the rejection of the postulates without
which it is impossible for human beings to reason at
all. It is a philosophy that destroys itself in destroying all
philosophy. The suicide does not need to be put to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the suicide, doubly slain in the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, may be used
as a warning of the consequence of doing violence to the
genuine common sense, or ideal man that is latent in each
man; especially on subjects in which doubt is easier than in
the case of outward things and persons. The ‘metaphysical
lunacy’ of doubt about the existence of other persons
may be acknowledged, while the common sense, unawake
in its moral or spiritual elements, fails to protest against
ethical atheism or agnosticism. What Reid calls the
common sense is alive consciously in various degrees, in
different persons, in different countries and periods. A
common sense of the existence of outward things and
persons is practically awake in all sane minds. But the
spiritual convictions, of which some are hardly conscious,
may be rejected even practically without obvious lunacy.
And something is gained for those convictions, if it can
be shown, as a <i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, that their rejection
involves the moral sceptic too in the ‘lunacy’ of universal
doubt and pessimist despair.</p>

<p>That Reid lays much stress on ‘calling in question the
common theory of ideas or images in perception’ is explained
by his assumption, that this theory involves perversion of the
common sense even in its preliminary contact with outward
things in sense, thus obviously discrediting it as the
final court of appeal in every other instance. It may in
this way be taken as a plea for a more faithful adherence
on the part of philosophers to the genuine common-sense
judgments, which can be made to respond to an adequate
appeal, however dormant they may be in individuals.
This final appeal to human nature must, in short, be to
human nature <em>as it is in fact</em>, not to human nature <em>as
distorted in hypothesis</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>For, after all, the root of the agnosticism which is found
in history alternating with the final faith of the common
sense, lies deeper than in mistaken hypotheses of philosophers
about our perceptions in sense. Reid’s substitution
in philosophy of immediate for mediate perception of
matter is therefore an inadequate cure. The periodically
returning doubt concerns, not the outness or inwardness
of what is revealed to sense, but the meaning and character
of the Power that is at work within the universe of
matter and mind, and with which we first come into
contact and collision in sense. Is it, in its final and
pervading Power, a bad or a good sort of universe that
we open our eyes upon, when we begin to exercise our
senses? What are its final relations to me, and my final
relations to it? Nobody doubts the existence of things
and persons, so far as they are revealed to the senses. But
what is our implied Common Sense of the final meaning of
the Whole? Am I to put an optimist or a pessimist ultimate
interpretation upon it all? The lurid mixture of pain and
pleasure, evil and good, presented by the animated world,
combined with spiritually dormant common sense in individual
men,—is surely a more potent factor of agnostic
doubt than an erroneous account of perception in circulation
among persons who speculate.</p>

<p>Reid’s course of thought amidst new surroundings in
Glasgow brought him nearer to the source and corrective
of the scepticism that is aroused by the suspicious-looking
universe of mingled good and evil, to which our sense
perceptions introduce us.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">GLASGOW COLLEGE: THE PROFESSOR OF
MORAL PHILOSOPHY<br />1764-1780</span></h2>

<p>In November 1764 we find Reid, now almost fifty-five years
of age, in the Chair of Moral Philosophy in the Old College
in the High Street of Glasgow. The Reid family lived then,
and for two years after, not in the Professors’ Court within
the College, but a quarter of a mile away, in an old-fashioned
street called the Drygate.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The manuscript in the family
bible records that Reid was admitted to the Glasgow professorship
on the 12th of June. He carried with him from
the quaint manse in Aberdeen to his new home in the
Drygate, his wife, three daughters, all above twenty years of
age, and two boys; they left three infant children buried
in Aberdeenshire. The Glasgow Chair supplied an income,
including fees, somewhat in advance of the Aberdeen
regency; and its duties required concentrated study of intellectual
and moral agency in man, instead of the dispersion
over a wide range of the phenomena and laws of matter
and mind which was necessary in King’s College. Yet it
was ‘not without reluctance,’ we are told, that he consented
to tear himself from a spot where he had so long been
fastening his roots; and much as he loved the society in
which he passed the remainder of his days, the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the change hardly compensated for the sacrifice of feeling
caused by the break in his early habits and associations.</p>

<p>Glasgow in 1898 is even more changed from Glasgow in
1764 than Aberdeen when Reid lived in it from Aberdeen
as it is now. To-day Glasgow is the second city in Britain,
with nearly a million of people, the industrial metropolis
of the north, with all the stir of industrial life. It was
then a provincial town with hardly thirty thousand inhabitants,
almost inaccessible from the sea, surrounded by the
cornfields and hedgerows and orchards of Lanarkshire, its
few streets converging on the Cathedral and the College
with their historic associations. ‘Glasgow,’ according to
<cite>Humphrey Clinker</cite>, ‘is the pride of Scotland. It is one of
the prettiest towns in Europe.’ Pennant describes it as ‘the
best built of any second-rate city I ever saw. The view from
the Cross has an air of vast magnificence.’ In 1764 it was
only laying the foundations of its present commercial fame.
The tobacco trade with the American plantations, and the
sugar trade with the West Indies, had hardly altered its
character as an ancient Church and University town.
‘Jupiter Carlyle,’ referring to Glasgow before the middle of
last century, speaks of ‘a few families of ancient citizens
who pretended to be gentlemen; and a few others, recently
settled, who had obtained wealth and consideration in trade.
The rest were shopkeepers and mechanics, who occupied
large warerooms to furnish cargoes to Virginia. It was then
usual for the sons of merchants to attend the College for
one or two years, and a few of them completed their
academical education.’</p>

<p>The College in the High Street, erected early in the
seventeenth century, seemed to Samuel Johnson in 1773
‘without a sufficient share in the magnificence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
place.’ Nevertheless he found ‘learning an object of wide
importance, and the habit of application much more general
than in the neighbouring University of Edinburgh.’ The
two College squares, connected with memories of many
generations in the west of Scotland, have been likened to
those of Lincoln College in Oxford. About the middle
of last century from three to four hundred students gathered
in those curious old courts, almost all living in apartments
in the town, a few boarded in the houses of professors.
They wore scarlet gowns, ‘most of which,’ when Wesley
visited Glasgow, ‘were very dirty, some very ragged, and
all of very coarse cloth.’ The houses of the professors
formed a square on the north side of the College, built
early in the eighteenth century. Eastward were the College
gardens and the park, through which the classic Molendinar
found its way to the Clyde. It was a quaint and curious
old-world life that was then lived in the College, and in the
High Street, passing from the College to the Cathedral at
one end and from the College to the Cross at the other.</p>

<p>In the half-century before Reid was admitted to his
Glasgow Chair, the University had professors of more than
Scottish reputation. Glasgow is in fact associated with
almost all the names that adorn the literature of Philosophy
in Scotland in the last century and in this. Adam Smith
was Reid’s immediate predecessor in the Chair of Morals.
His <cite>Theory of Moral Sentiments</cite> had been for five years
before the world when he resigned his professorship to
give to literature what Sir James Mackintosh describes
as ‘perhaps the only book which produced an immediate,
general, and irrevocable change in some of the most important
parts of the legislation of all civilised states’—fit to
be ranked with the classic works of Grotius, Locke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Montesquieu—its author ‘the first economical philosopher,
and perhaps the most eloquent theoretical moralist, of
modern times.’ Smith’s predecessor was Francis Hutcheson,
author of that <cite>Inquiry into our Ideas of Beauty and
Virtue</cite> which gave rise to Reid’s New Machar essay on
‘Quantity’ in 1748, the reputed father of modern philosophy
in Scotland;—and in the second quarter of last century the
most potent agent and pioneer of the liberal culture and
literary taste which made the intellectual moderation of
the eighteenth century in Scotland so remarkable a contrast
to the less tolerant spiritual fervour of the seventeenth.
This influence was continued by his friend and
biographer, William Leechman, the Principal of Glasgow
College in 1764, still remembered as one of the philosophical
theologians of the Church of Scotland. ‘It was owing to
Hutcheson and Leechman,’ says Carlyle, ‘that a new
school was formed in the western provinces of Scotland,
where the clergy till that period were narrow and bigoted,
and had never ventured to range their minds beyond the
bounds of strict orthodoxy. For though neither of these
professors taught any heresy, yet they opened and enlarged
the minds of the students, which soon gave them a turn
for inquiry; the result of which was candour and liberality
of sentiment. From experience this freedom of thought
was not found so dangerous as might at first be apprehended;
for though the more daring youth at first made
excursions into the unbounded regions of metaphysical
perplexity, yet all the more judicious soon returned to the
lower sphere of long-established truths, which they found
not only more subservient to the good order of society,
but necessary to fix their own minds in some degree of
stability.’ Gershom Carmichael, too, is not to be forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
He was Hutcheson’s predecessor, with an intellectual and
religious influence not inconsiderable in the opening years
of last century, author of a Latin manual of logic which
appeared in 1720, and a <cite>Synopsis Theologiæ Naturalis</cite>,
published shortly before his death in 1729, but best known
perhaps as editor of Puffendorff.</p>

<p>Reid thus entered Glasgow College when it was the
centre of the reviving philosophical and literary activity
of Scotland in the modern spirit. He met colleagues
and fellow-citizens who were in sympathy with his own
sincere and independent scientific temper. The aged
Simpson, restorer of ancient geometry, who had lately
retired from the mathematical chair, which he had adorned
for half a century, was a congenial mathematician of
European fame. Joseph Black, the most celebrated British
chemist of his generation, was illustrating his own discoveries
in his College lectures, and drawing the attention
of the world to the phenomena of latent heat. The
vigour and acuteness of Millar were educating a new generation
in jurisprudence and statesmanship. Moore, the
author of <cite>Zeluco</cite>, an eminent Glasgow physician, was adding
to its literary name. The grandfather, and afterwards the
father, of Sir William Hamilton held in succession the
Chair of Anatomy, both colleagues of Reid, who might
have been seen in the College Courts when his future
editor and commentator was there in his infancy.</p>

<p>Reid’s inaugural lecture as Professor of Moral Philosophy,
delivered on the 10th of October 1764, is among his unpublished
manuscripts at Birkwood. The opening sentences
(deleted as irrelevant in after years) are not without interest
in the characteristic modesty and candour of the reference
to Adam Smith, his predecessor:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Before entering upon the subject of my prelections, there
are some things which I think proper to lay before you, and to
which I beg your attention. I doubt not that you are all
sensible of the loss which the University, and you in particular,
sustain by the resignation of the learned and ingenious gentleman
who last filled this chair. Those who knew him most and
had most access to attend his prelections, and especially those
who most profited by them, will be most sensible of their loss.
I had not the happiness of his personal acquaintance, for want of
opportunity; though I wished for it, and now wish for it far more
than ever. But I could not be a stranger to his fame and
reputation, nor to the respect with which his lectures from this
chair were heard by a very crowded audience. I am much a
stranger to his system, unless so far as he hath published it to
the world. But a man of so great genius and penetration must
have struck new light to the subjects which he treated, as well
as have handled them in an excellent and instructive manner.
I shall be much obliged to any of you, gentlemen, or to any
others, who can furnish me with notes of his prelections,
whether in morals, jurisprudence, politics, or rhetorick. I
shall always be desirous to borrow light from every quarter,
and to adopt what appears to me sound and solid in every
system, and ready to change my opinions upon conviction, or
to change my method and materials where I can do it to
advantage. I desire to live no longer than this candour and
ingenuity, this openness of mind to education and information,
live with me.’</p>

</div>

<p>An apology follows for the imperfect preparation of a
first course, inadequately provided for by the miscellaneous
lectures in physics and metaphysics at Aberdeen. The
past performance of Adam Smith, and the high expectation
associated with the new professor, the author of the
<cite>Inquiry</cite>, were doubtless fresh in the minds of the crowded
audience that met on that October morning in the faint
light of the Old College class-room. The audience, the
new professor, and his predecessor, have all now receded
into the dim distance, and are seen under the cold light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of history. The lectures delivered in the years that followed
are preserved at Birkwood, in Reid’s valley of the Dee—lectures
on Pneumatology, Ethics, Jurisprudence, and
Political Philosophy—for the most part embodied in substance
in the published <cite>Essays</cite> of his old age.</p>

<p>Reid’s placid temperament and restrained imagination
suggest sober unadorned statement, and cautious inference
founded on fact, not fervid eloquence, as the character of
his prelections. He was more likely slowly to influence
opinion by his books than to startle a youthful audience
by spoken words. This conjecture is confirmed by the
account of Reid in the Glasgow class-room given by Dugald
Stewart, who was among his students in 1772-73. ‘In his
elocution and mode of instruction,’ Stewart says, ‘there
was nothing peculiarly attractive. He seldom if ever indulged
in the warmth of extempore discourse; nor was his
manner of reading calculated to increase the effect of what
he had committed to writing. Such, however, was the
simplicity and perspicuity of his style, such the gravity and
authority of his character, and such the general interest of
his young hearers in the doctrines which he taught, that
by the numerous audiences to which his instructions were
addressed he was heard uniformly with the most silent
and respectful attention.’ And this delivery of deep and
patient thought, regarding the duties and relations of man,
and the foundation of his beliefs, was continued in the
class-room for sixteen years.</p>

<p>As we might expect from their mental affinities, Reid
greatly esteemed the works of Bishop Butler. Among the
manuscripts at Birkwood is an abstract of the <cite>Analogy</cite>;
and Butler’s ethical writings were recommended to his
students as the best in the literature of moral philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with regret to see them superseded in England by the productions
of inferior moralists. In tone and method of
inquiry Reid is the Butler of Scotland. And Butler,
too, is the Reid of England in his trustful appeals to what
Reid would call the common sense. When Butler asks himself
whether we may not be deceived in our natural sense
of our continuous personal identity, he replies, that ‘this
question may be asked at the end of any demonstration;
because it is a question concerning the truth of perception
by memory. And he who can doubt whether perception
by memory can in this case be depended on, may doubt
also whether perception, by reasoning, or indeed whether
any intuitive perception, can. Here then we can go no
further. For it is ridiculous to attempt to <em>prove</em> the truth
of those perceptions, whose truth we can no otherwise
prove than by other perceptions which there is just the
same ground to suspect; or to attempt to prove the truth
of our faculties, which can no otherwise be proved than by
these very suspected faculties themselves.’ This is the
substance of the argument that rests on the data of the
sense or reason with which human nature is inspired.</p>

<p>Reid’s homely letters to his Aberdeen friends, Andrew
and David Skene, give some interesting pictures of the
details of the family’s life, in the years which immediately
followed the settlement in Glasgow. The extracts that
follow may help the reader to form the pictures.</p>

<p>In a letter to Dr. Andrew Skene, dated November 15,
1764, we see the Moral Philosophy class-room on a winter
morning a hundred and thirty years ago, and life in the
Drygate home a few weeks after the family entered it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I must launch forth in the morning, so as to be at the
College (which is a walk of eight minutes) half an hour after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seven, when I speak for an hour without interruption to an
audience of about a hundred. At eleven I examine for an hour
upon my morning prelection; but my audience is a little
more than a third part of what it was in the morning. In a
week or two I must, for three days in the week, have a second
prelection at twelve, upon a different subject, where my audience
will be made up of those who hear me in the morning but
do not attend at eleven. My hearers commonly attend my
class two years at least. They pay fees for the first two years,
and then they are <i lang="la">cives</i> of the class, and may attend gratis as
many years as they please. Many attend the moral philosophy
class four or five years; so that I have many preachers and
students of divinity and law of considerable standing, before
whom I stand in awe to speak without more preparation than
I have leisure for. I have a great inclination to attend some of
the professors here, several of whom are very eminent in their
way; but I cannot find leisure. Much time is consumed in our
college meetings about business, of which we have commonly
four or five in the week. We have a Literary Society once a
week, consisting of the Masters and two or three more; where
each of the members has a discourse once in the session....
Near a third part of our students are Irish. Thirty came over
lately in one ship, besides three that went to Edinburgh. We
have a good many English, and some foreigners. Many of the
Irish, as well as Scotch, are poor, and come up late to save
money; so that we are not yet fully convened, although I have
been teaching ever since the 10th of October. Those who pretend
to know, say that the number of students this year, when fully
convened, will amount to 300.... By this time I am sure you
have enough of the College; for you know as much as I can
tell you of the fine houses of the Masters, of the Astronomical
Observatory, of Robin Foulis’ collection of pictures and painting
college, and of the foundry for types and printing-house.
Therefore I will carry you home to my own house, which lyes
among the middle of the weavers, like the back-wynd in Aberdeen.
You go through a long, dark, abominably nasty entry,
which leads you into a clean little close. You walk upstairs
to a neat little dining-room, and find as many other little rooms
as just accommodate my family; so scantily that my apartment
is a closet of six feet by eight or nine off the dining-room.
To balance these little inconveniences, the house is new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
free of buggs; it has the best air and finest prospect in Glasgow;
the privilege of a large garden, very airy, to walk in,
which is not so nicely kept, but one may use freedom with it.
A five minutes’ walk leads us up a rocky precipice into a large
park, partly planted with firs, and partly open, which overlooks
the town and all the country round, and gives a view of the
windings of the Clyde for a great way. The ancient Cathedral
stands at the foot of the rock, half of its height below you, and
half above you; and indeed it is a very magnificent pile.
When we came here, the street we live in (which is called the
Drygate) was infested with the small-pox, which were very
mortal. Two families in our neighbourhood lost all their
children, being three each. Little David was seized with the
infection, and had a very great eruption both on his face and
over his whole body, which you will believe would discompose
his mother.... Although my salary here be the same as
Aberdeen, yet if the class does not fall off, nor my health, so
as to disable me from teaching, I believe I shall be able to live
as easily as at Aberdeen, notwithstanding the differences in
the expense of living at the two places. I have touched about
£70 of fees, and may possibly make out the £100 this session....
The common people here have a gloom in their countenance,
which I am at a loss whether to ascribe to their religion or to
the air and climate. There is certainly more of religion among
the common people in this town than in Aberdeen; and
although it has a gloomy enthusiastical cast, yet I think it
makes them tame and sober. I have not heard either of a
house or of a head broke, or of a pocket picked, or of any
flagrant crime, since I came here. I have not heard any
swearing in the streets, nor seen a man drunk (excepting,
<i lang="la">inter nos</i>, one Prof—r) since I came here.... If this scroll
tire you, impute it to this, that to-morrow is to be employed
in choosing a Rector, and I can sleep till ten o’clock, which I
shall not do again for six weeks.’</p>

</div>

<p>After the first winter, and when he had gained some experience
of Glasgow, he writes to Dr. David Skene, on 13th
July 1765:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I have a strong inclination to attend the chymical lecture
the next winter; but am afraid I shall not have time. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had but very imperfect hints of Dr. Black’s theory of fire....
Chemistry seems to be the only branch of philosophy that can
be said to be in a progressive state here, although other
branches are neither ill taught nor ill studied. I never considered
Dolland’s telescopes till I came here. I think they
open a new field in optics which may greatly enrich that part
of philosophy.... I find a variety of things here to amuse me
in the literary world, and want nothing so much as my old
friends, whose place I cannot expect at my time of life to
supply. I think the common people here and in the neighbourhood
greatly inferior to the common people with you.
They are Bœotian in their understandings, fanatical in their
religion, and clownish in their dress and manners. The clergy
encourage this fanaticism too much, and find it the only way
to popularity. I often hear a gospel here which you know
nothing about; for you neither hear it from the pulpit nor will
you find it in the Bible. What is your Philosophical Society
doing? Still battling about D. Hume? or have you time to
look in?... I believe you do not like to be charged with
compliments, otherwise I would desire of you to remember me
respectfully to Sir Archibald Grant, Sir Arthur and Lady
Forbes, and others of my country acquaintances, when you
have occasion to see them.’</p>

</div>

<p>In another letter to Dr. David, written about Christmas
in his second winter, we find that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Mr. Watt has made two small improvements in the steam-engine.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
[These are minutely described.] ... I have attended
Dr. Black’s lectures. His doctrine of latent heat is the only
thing I have yet heard that is altogether new. And indeed I
look upon it as a very great discovery.... I have not met
with any botanists here. Our College is considerably more
crowded than it was last session. My class indeed is much the
same as last year, but all the rest are better. I believe the
number of our students of one kind or another may be between
four and five hundred. But the College at Edinburgh is increased
this year much more than we are. The Moral Philosophy
class there is more than double ours. The Professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Ferguson, is indeed, as far as I can judge, a man of a noble
spirit, of very elegant manners, and has an uncommon flow of
eloquence. I hear he is about to publish, I don’t know under
what title, a natural history of man; exhibiting a view of him
in the savage state, and in the several successive states of
pasturage, agriculture, and commerce. Our Society [Senate]
is not so harmonious as I wish. Schemes of interest, pushed
by some and opposed by others, are like to divide us into
parties, and perhaps engage us in law suits. Mrs. Reid,
Pegie, and I, have all had a severe cold and cough. I have
been keeping the house these two days in order to get the
better of it.’</p>

</div>

<p>On ‘December 30th, 1765,’ a less sanguine view appears,
in a letter to Andrew Skene:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I assure you I can rarely find an hour which I am at liberty
to dispose of as I please. The most disagreeable thing in the
teaching part is to have a great number of stupid Irish
teagues, who attend classes for two or three years to qualify
them for teaching schools or being dissenting teachers. I
preach to them as St. Francis did to the fishes. I don’t know
what pleasure he had in his audience; but I should have none
in mine, if there were not in it a mixture of reasonable creatures.
I confess I think there is a smaller proportion of these in my
class this year than there was the last. I have long been of
the opinion that, in a right constituted College, there ought to
be two professors for each class—one for the dunces, and
another for those who have parts. The province of the former
would not be the most agreeable, but perhaps it would require
the greatest talents, and therefore ought to be accounted the
post of honour. There is no part of my time more disagreeably
spent than that which is spent in college meetings; and I
should have been attending one at this moment if a bad cold I
have got had not furnished me with an excuse. These meetings
are become more disagreeable by an evil spirit of party that
seems to put us in a ferment, and I am afraid will produce bad
consequences. The temper of our northern Colonies makes
mercantile people here look very grave. It is said that the
effects in these colonies belonging to this town amount to above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
£400,000.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The mercantile people are for suspending the
Stamp-act, and redressing the grievances of the colonists....
In what light the House of Commons will view this matter I
don’t know, but it seems to me one of the most important
matters that have come before them. I wish often an evening
with you, such as we have enjoyed in the days of former times,
to settle the important affairs of Church and State, of Colleges
and Corporations. I have found this the best expedient to
think of them without melancholy and chagrin. And I think
all that a man has to do in the world is to keep his temper and
to do his duty. Mrs. Reid is tolerably well just now, but is
often ailing.’</p>

</div>

<p>In a letter to Dr. David, in March 1766, he refers to the
death of his early friend, John Stewart, the Mathematical
Professor in Marischal College, and his companion in the
English tour thirty years before:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Mr. Stewart’s death affects me deeply. A sincere friendship,
begun at twelve years of age, and continued to my time of
life, without any interruption, cannot but give some pangs.
You know his worth; yet it was shaded ever since you knew
him by too great abstraction from the world. The former part
of his life was more amiable and more social; but the whole
was of a piece in virtue, candour, and humanity.... I have
always regarded him as my best tutor, though of the same age
with me. If the giddy part of my life was in any degree spent
innocently and virtuously, I owe it to him more than to any
human creature; for I could not but be virtuous in his company,
and I could not be so happy in any other. But I must leave
this pleasing melancholy subject. He is happy; and I shall
often be happy in the remembrance of our friendship; and I
hope we shall meet again.’</p>

</div>

<p>A minute account of Black’s theory of latent heat follows.</p>

<p>Later in the same year, Black was called to the Chair of
Chemistry in Edinburgh, which he filled for nearly thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
years, and in Reid’s letters to the Skenes there is much
about candidates for the vacant office in Glasgow, with a
suggestion that David Skene should himself enter the lists.
‘There is a great spirit of inquiry among the young people
here. Literary merit is much regarded; and I conceive
the opportunities a man has of improving himself are much
greater here than at Aberdeen. The communication with
Edinburgh is easy. One goes in the stage coach to Edinburgh
before dinner; has all the afternoon there, and returns to
dinner at Glasgow next day; so that if you have any ambition
to get into the College of Edinburgh (which I think you
ought to have), I conceive Glasgow would be a good step.’</p>

<p>The appeal was ineffectual. Meantime his own appointment,
as an ‘examinator’ of candidates for the vacant Mathematical
Chair in Marischal College, made a visit to Aberdeen
necessary, as anticipated in a letter on ‘May 8th’:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘My class will be over in less than a month, and by that time
I shall be glad to have some respite. I hope to have the
pleasure of seeing my friends in Aberdeen in August, if not
sooner. We have had a stronger College this year than ever
before. We have been remarkably free from riots and disorders
among the students; and I did not indeed expect that 350
young fellows could have keen kept quiet for so many months
with so little trouble.... You’ll say to all this that cadgers
are aye speaking of crooksaddles. I think so they ought;
besides, I have nothing else to say to you, and have had no
time to think of anything but my crooksaddles for seven months
past. When the session’s over, I must rub up my mathematics
against the month of August. There is one candidate for your
profession of mathematics to go from this College; and if your
College get a better man, or a better mathematician, they will
be very lucky.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I am so sensible of the honour the Magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
have done me in naming me to be one of the examinators, that
I will not decline it, though I confess I like the honour better
than the office.’</p>

</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1766 Reid exchanged the house in the
Drygate for an official residence in the Professors’ Court
of the Old College. This appears in a letter to Dr.
Andrew Skene on December 17th:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I live now in the College, and have no distance to walk to
my class in dark mornings, as I had before. I enjoy this ease,
though I am not sure whether the necessity of walking up and
down a steep hill<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> three or four times a day was not of use. I
have of late had a little of your distemper, finding a giddiness
in my head when I lie down, or rise, or turn myself in my bed.
Our College is very well peopled this session. My public class
is above three score, besides the private class. Dr. Smith
never had so many in one year. There is nothing so uneasy
to me here as our factions in the College.’</p>

</div>

<p>In February 1767, along with other local news, we find
this in a letter to David Skene:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘We are now resolved to have a canal from Carron to this
place, if the Parliament allows it. £40,000 was subscribed last
week by the merchants of the Carron Company for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Our medical college has fallen off greatly this session, most of
the students of medicine having followed Dr. Black to Edinburgh.
The natural and moral philosophy classes are more
numerous than they have ever been; but I expect a great
falling off, if I see another session. I was just now seeing your
furnace along with Dr. Irvine.... If I could find a machine
as proper for analysing ideas, moral sentiments, and other
materials belonging to the fourth kingdom, I believe I should
find in my heart to bestow the money first. I have the more
use for a machine of this kind, because my alembic for performing
these operations—I mean my cranium—has been a
little out of order this winter, by a vertigo, which has made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
my studies go on heavily, though it has not hitherto interrupted
my teaching. I have found air and exercise and a clean
stomach the best remedies; but I cannot command the two
former as often as I could wish. I am sensible that the air of
a crowded class is bad, and often thought of carrying my class
to the Common Hall; but I was afraid it might have been construed
as a piece of ostentation.’</p>

</div>

<p>Reid’s letter of condolence to Dr. David Skene on the
death of his father, in September 1767, mentions the loss
of his own infant daughter, ‘my sweet little Bess,’ and also
refers to an excursion to Hamilton ‘with Mr. Beattie’—the
only occasion on which, for more than three months, he
had been more than three miles from Glasgow. ‘Having
time at command,’ he had been tempted ‘to fall to the
tumbling over books; as we have a vast number here
which I had not access to see at Aberdeen. But this is
a <i lang="la">mare magnum</i>, wherein one is tempted by hopes of discoveries
to make a tedious voyage, which seldom repays
the labour. I have long ago found my memory to be
like a vessel that is full: if you pour in more, you lose
as much as you gain; and on this account I have a thousand
times resolved to give up all pretence to what is called
learning, being satisfied that it is more profitable to ruminate
on the little I have laid up than to add to the indigested
heap. I have had little society, the College people being
out of town, and have almost lost the faculty of speaking by
disuse. I blame myself for having corresponded so little
with my friends at Aberdeen. I wished to try Lumsden’s
experiment which you was so good as to communicate to
me.... A nasty custom I have of chewing tobacco has
been the reason of my observing a species of as nasty little
animals. I spit in a basin of sawdust, which, when it comes
to be drenched, produces a vast number of animals, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
or four times as large as a louse, and not very different in
shape; but armed with four or five rows of prickles like
a hedgehog, which seem to serve it as feet. Its motion
is very sluggish. It lies drenched in the aforesaid mass,
which swarms with these animals of all ages from top to
bottom.... I have gone over Sir James Stewart’s great
book of political economy, wherein I think there is a great
deal of good material—carelessly put together indeed; but
I think it contains more sound principles concerning commerce
and police than any book we have yet had. We had
the favour of a visit from Sir Archibald Grant. It gave
me much pleasure to see him retain his spirits and vigour.’
A letter in October mentions that Reid had ‘passed eight
days lately with Lord Kames at Blair-Drummond,’ and that
his lordship is preparing a fourth edition of his <cite>Elements</cite>.
He adds, ‘I have been labouring at <cite>Barbara Celarent</cite> for
three weeks bygone.’ A new friend, Lord Kames, here
comes in sight.</p>

<p>The last of the Skene letters is dated three years later,
in 1770. After pressing David Skene to visit him in
Glasgow, he ends thus:—‘As to myself, the immaterial
world has swallowed up all my thoughts since I came here;
but I meet with few that have travelled far in that region,
and am often left to pursue my dreary way in a more
solitary manner than when we used to meet at the Club.’</p>

<p>The homely simplicity of Reid’s character is shown in
those letters. They differ from the letters we have after
the Skenes disappear. These are almost all on questions
in philosophy, and show a slow but steady advance
in reflection upon the ‘common sense’ constitution of
man’s knowledge of the universe of matter and mind.</p>

<p>In 1772 there was sorrow in the Reid household. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
two eldest daughters, Jane and Margaret, both died, in the
bloom of youth, leaving only the third daughter, Martha,
who not long after married Dr. Patrick Carmichael, a
Glasgow physician, and youngest son of Professor Gershom
Carmichael. This marriage added much to the comfort of
Reid’s later years.</p>

<p>We have a passing glimpse of Reid in 1773, when he
was entertained in Glasgow by Johnson and Boswell, at the
<i>Saracen’s Head Inn</i>, in the Gallowgate, ‘that paragon of
inns in the eyes of the Scotch, but wretchedly managed.’
The travellers arrived there on the 28th of October, on
their return from their romantic excursion to the Western
Highlands. At the <i>Saracen’s Head</i>, on the following
morning, as Boswell tells us, ‘Dr. Reid, the philosopher,
and two other Glasgow professors, breakfasted with us,’
and they met them afterwards at supper. ‘I was not
much pleased with any of them,’ the sage wrote to Mrs.
Thrale. ‘The general impression upon my memory,’
Boswell says, ‘is, that we had not much conversation at
Glasgow, where the professors, like their brethren at Aberdeen,
did not venture to expose themselves much to the
battery of cannon which they knew might play upon them.’
It is a pity that Boswell’s indifference, or indolence, on
this occasion has deprived us of talk at the <i>Saracen’s Head</i>
and in the College Court, as dramatic in its way as the
pictures of Rasay or Inch Kenneth. Notwithstanding
Reid’s cautious and modest silence, or want of vivacity,
he surely said and heard something at those Glasgow
breakfasts and suppers.</p>

<p class="tb">Before death had put an end to the letters to the Skenes,
Reid had become intimate with one of the most notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
men of the time in Scotland. I do not know how the
intimacy began, but as early as 1767 we have found him
referring to a visit to Lord Kames at Blair-Drummond, and
to the mysteries of <cite>Barbara Celarent</cite>. This means that he
was at work on the <cite>Brief Account of Aristotle’s Logic, with
Remarks</cite>, published seven years afterwards as an Appendix
to one of Lord Kames’ <cite>Sketches of the History of Man</cite>.
The <cite>Sketches</cite> appeared in two quarto volumes, in 1774,
and the <cite>Brief Account</cite> fills about seventy pages in the
second volume. It was Reid’s only appearance in print
in the sixteen years of his public professorship in Glasgow.
This, along with the essay on Quantity, given to the Royal
Society in 1748, and the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, in 1764, made up his
work as an author, until after he had ceased to be an oral
teacher.</p>

<p>In Henry Home, Lord Kames, notwithstanding a temperament
very different from his own, Reid found congenial
companionship—a strong disposition to metaphysical speculation,
a ready and accomplished if not deeply learned
lawyer, and a considerable author. Kames was fourteen
years his senior. Curiously, Henry Home’s closest early
friendship was with David Hume. Thirty years before his
friendship with Reid, he advised Hume about the <cite>Treatise
of Human Nature</cite>, and had given the youth an introduction
to Bishop Butler. ‘My opinions,’ David writes in 1737,
‘are so new, and even some terms I am obliged to make
use of, that I could not propose, by any abridgment, to
give my system an air of likelihood, or even to make it
intelligible. I have had a greater desire of communicating
to you a plan of the whole, that I believe it will not appear
in public before the beginning of next winter. I am at
present castrating my work, that is, cutting off its nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
parts, that is, endeavouring it shall give as little offence as
possible. This is a piece of cowardice for which I blame
myself. But I resolved not to be an enthusiast in philosophy
while I was blaming other enthusiasms.’ It was thus
that Hume wrote about the book which, even in its ‘castrated’
form, startled Reid in the manse at New Machar,
and determined his whole intellectual life. In 1751 Home
published <cite>Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural
Religion</cite>, on which Jonathan Edwards congratulated him
in a letter to Dr. Erskine. Yet his speculations, and his
association with the sceptic, raised a suspicion of his orthodoxy
in the General Assembly.</p>

<p>According to Lord Woodhouselee, his biographer, ‘the
intercourse of Lord Kames was frequent with his much-valued
friend Dr. Reid, and they corresponded on various
topics of philosophy—a correspondence which, notwithstanding
the dissimilarity of character in many respects
between these two eminent men, subsisted for a long period
of years, with the most perfect cordiality and mutual esteem.’
Dr. Reid, Dugald Stewart tells us, lived in the most cordial
and affectionate friendship with Lord Kames, notwithstanding
the avowed opposition of their sentiments on
some moral questions to which he attached the highest
importance. Both of them, however, were the friends of
virtue and of mankind; and both were able to temper the
warmth of free discussion with the forbearance and good
humour founded on mutual esteem. ‘No two men,’
Stewart adds, ‘ever exhibited a more striking contrast in
their conversation or in their constitutional tempers—the
one slow and cautious in his decisions, even on those topics
which he had most diligently studied; reserved and silent
in promiscuous society, and retaining, after all his literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
eminence, the same simple and unassuming manners which
he had brought from his country residence; the other, lively,
rapid, and communicative; accustomed by his professional
pursuits to wield with address the weapons of controversy,
and not averse to a trial of his powers on questions the
most foreign to his ordinary habits of inquiry. But these
characteristical differences, while to their common friends
they lent an additional charm to the distinguishing merits
of each, served only to enliven their social intercourse, and
to cement their mutual attachment.’ From 1767 till the
death of Lord Kames in December 1782, their intercourse
was unbroken.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Lord Kames thus explains Reid’s contribution to the
<cite>Sketches</cite>:—‘In reviewing the foregoing Sketch, it occurred
to me that a fair analysis of Aristotle’s logic would be a
valuable addition to the historical branch. A distinct
and candid account of a system that for so many ages
governed the reasoning part of mankind cannot but be
acceptable to the public. Curiosity will be gratified in
seeing a phantom delineated that so long fascinated the
learned world; a phantom which, like the pyramids of Egypt,
or hanging gardens of Babylon, is a structure of infinite
genius, but absolutely useless, unless for raising wonder.
Dr. Reid, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the College of
Glasgow, relished the thought, and his friendship to me
prevailed on him, after much solicitation, to undertake the
laborious task. No man is better acquainted with Aristotle’s
writings; and (without any enthusiastic attachment) he
holds that philosopher to be a first-rate genius.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Measured by the present standard of Aristotelian criticism,
Reid’s exposition of the Organon, and estimate of its
place in the development of human understanding, may
seem meagre and inadequate; especially as the issue of
seven years of preparation, and as his solitary contribution
to philosophy in these sixteen years. But when we remember
that Aristotelian logic was then under an eclipse,
especially in Scotland, and that Reid’s ‘Brief Account’ was
an attempt to draw the Organon out of the obscurity to
which it had been condemned by leaders of modern thought,
the merit of his sober and sagacious commentary may be
more recognised. It is as a signal monument of abstracted
intellectual activity, rather than as a philosophical instrument
for advancing or organising our knowledge, that
Reid regards the syllogistic logic. He concludes that the
art of syllogism is better fitted to promote scholastic litigation
than real improvement in the sciences; he sees in it
only ‘a venerable piece of antiquity and a great effort of
human genius.’ When he contrasts the utility of Bacon’s
<cite>Organum</cite>, as a factor in the progressive intelligence of
mankind, he fails to see that each Organon may consistently
supplement the other.</p>

<p>Reid characteristically ends his account of the old
Organon by suggesting an Organon, different from either the
old or the new, as still wanting. This should neither, like
Aristotle’s, unfold only abstract forms of deductive reasoning,
nor, like Bacon’s, only methods for verifying inductive
generalisations. It should be concerned with the rational
principles which compose the Common Sense of mankind.
‘All the real knowledge of mankind may be divided into
two parts: the first consists of self-evident propositions, the
second of those which are deduced by just reasoning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
self-evident propositions. The line that divides these two
ought to be marked as distinctly as possible, and principles
that are really self-evident reduced to general axioms.
Although first principles do not admit of direct proof, yet
there must be certain marks by which those that are truly
such may be distinguished from counterfeits. These marks
ought to be described and applied to distinguish the
genuine from the spurious.... This is a subject of such
importance that if inquisitive men can be brought to the
same unanimity in the first principles of the other sciences
as in those of mathematics and natural philosophy, this
might be considered as a third grand era in the progress of
human reason.’ Thus in 1774 Reid’s thought still converges
on the subject which had engaged him since the
<cite>Treatise of Human Nature</cite> found its way into the manse
of New Machar. Perhaps he was unduly sanguine in
expecting unanimity regarding the ingredients of the final
reason of mankind—so imperfectly developed in the individual
consciousness, in its higher elements, as long as
men are disposed to resist the final venture of the heart
and conscience in their interpretation of the world and
of human life.</p>

<p>It was in 1774 that Reid’s appeal in 1764 to the common
reason of human nature aroused hostile criticism. He had
been seconded by others in his response to the sceptics.
The resort to a ‘sense’ of self-evident truth, in his <cite>Inquiry</cite>
in 1764, which itself looked like a reply to argument by
feeling, was followed in 1766 by <cite>An Appeal to Common
Sense on behalf of Religion</cite>, by Dr. James Oswald, minister
of Methven in Perthshire. In 1770 Beattie’s <cite>Essay on the
Nature and Immutability of Truth, in opposition to Sophistry
and Scepticism</cite>, followed. Oswald and Beattie were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
deep and patient thinkers like Reid;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but the rising literary
and social reputation of Beattie, secured for the <cite>Essay on
Truth</cite> more rapid and widespread admiration than was given
to the <cite>Inquiry</cite>. Beattie often visited London, was there
one of the lions of the day, was made a D.C.L. of Oxford,
and had interviews with George the Third, who admired his
book, conferred a pension on Beattie, and rallied Mr.
Dundas about ‘Scotch Philosophy.’ Reid, Beattie, and
Oswald thus became known as a triumvirate of ‘Scottish
Philosophers’; and the appeal to common sense, in which
they were at least verbally agreed, began to be spoken about
as ‘the Scottish Philosophy,’ a term which has since been
adopted in this country and abroad.</p>

<p>This Scottish triumvirate, helped into vogue by Beattie,
roused Joseph Priestley, an English dissenter. Priestley had
abandoned the Calvinism of his early creed for materialism,
philosophical necessity, and free thought, and, after serving
for some years as pastor of a nonconformist chapel in
Cheshire, and next as a schoolmaster much devoted to
experiments in the natural sciences, was already known as
an author in natural science. In 1774, when he was living
with Lord Shelburne, as librarian and literary companion,
he appeared for the first time as a metaphysical critic, in <cite>An
Examination of Reid’s Inquiry, Beattie’s Essay, and Oswald’s
Appeal to Common Sense</cite>. He played upon the term ‘common
sense,’ and took for granted that the aim of the
triumvirate was to substitute mere feeling and authority for
reason,—the authority of the multitude for that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
philosophical elect,—alleging blind instinct when unable to
produce argument, and multiplying instincts to suit each
controversial emergency. ‘As men have imagined innate
ideas, because they had forgot how they came by their
ideas, the Scottish philosophers set up almost as many distinct
instincts as there are acquired principles of acting.’
He ridiculed Reid for his supposed discovery of the root of
scepticism in the ideal hypothesis; charging him with innocently
mistaking a metaphor for a scientific theory, and for
overlooking the leading part which mental association plays,
as the cause of those convictions which Reid mistook for
infallible constituents of common sense. ‘If we consider
the general tenor of the writings of these philosophers,’
Dr. Priestley said, ‘it will appear that they are saying one
thing and doing another—talking plausibly about the necessity
for admitting axioms as the foundation of all reasoning,
but meaning to recommend particular assumptions of their
own as axioms—not as being founded on perception of the
agreement of ideas, which is the great doctrine of Mr. Locke,
and which makes truth to depend upon the necessary nature
of things, to be therefore absolute, unchangeable, and everlasting,
but merely on some unaccountable instinctive persuasions,
depending upon the arbitrary constitution of our
nature—which makes all truth be relative to ourselves only,
and consequently to be infinitely vague and precarious.
This system admits of no final appeal to reason properly
considered, which any person might be at liberty to examine
and discuss; on the contrary every man is taught to think
himself authorised to pronounce dogmatically upon every
question, according to his present feeling and persuasion,
under the notion of its being something original, instructive,
and incontrovertible; although, stoutly analysed, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
appear to be mere prejudice.’ Thus, as opposed to the
man of straw he set up under the name of Reid, Priestley
postulated a materialistic conception of man, as only an
organism, the so-called mental and moral power of which
was the natural issue of physical structure; his perceptions
the effects of their own objects; and on the whole a
necessitated system of the universe, which excluded morally
responsible agency.</p>

<p>Reid made no reply at the time to this argumentative
discharge. In an unpublished letter to Dr. Price he gives
a reason for his silence. ‘I will not answer Dr. Priestley,’
he says, ‘because he is very lame in abstract reasoning. I
have got no light from him. And indeed what light with
respect to the powers of the mind can one expect from a
man who has not yet learned to distinguish ideas from
vibrations, nor motion from sensation, nor simple apprehension
from judgment, nor simple ideas from complex ideas,
nor necessary truths from contingent truths?’<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In 1775
Reid writes to Lord Kames:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Dr. Priestley in his last book thinks that the power of perception,
as much as the other powers that are termed mental,
is the natural result of an organic structure such as that of the
human brain. Consequently, the whole man becomes extinct
at death; and we have no hope of surviving the grave but what
is derived from the Christian revelation. I would be glad to
know your lordship’s opinion, whether, when my brain has lost
its original structure, and when some hundred years after, the
same materials are again fabricated so curiously as to become
an intelligent being—whether, I say, that being will be <em>me</em>; or
if two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain,
whether they will all be <em>me</em>, and consequently be all one and
the same intelligent being. This seems to me a great mystery;
but Dr. Priestley denies all mysteries.... I am not surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that your lordship has found little entertainment in a late
French writer on human nature. From what I learn the
French philosophers are become rank Epicureans. I detest
all systems that depreciate human nature. If it be a delusion
that there is something in the constitution of man that is venerable
and worthy of its author, let me live and die in this
delusion rather than have my eyes opened to see my species
in a disgusting light. Every good man feels his indignation
rise against those who disparage his kindred or country; why
should it not rise against those who disparage his kind? Were
it not that we sometimes see extremes meet, I should think it
very strange to see atheists and high-shod divines contending
who should most blacken and degenerate human nature. Yet
I think the atheist acts the most consistent part of the two;
for surely such views of human nature tend more to promote
atheism than to promote religion and virtue.’</p>

</div>

<p>This allusion to contemporary French philosophers is
almost the only one I find in Reid. The chief works of
Condillac appeared before the <cite>Inquiry</cite>, but it does not
seem that they, or Diderot and the French Encyclopedists,
were known to him. That Kant is not referred to, nor
even known by name, is less surprising. This ignorance is
characteristic of Reid’s home-bred, self-contained philosophy.</p>

<p>Inquiry into our conception of Power or Causation becomes
prominent in Reid’s letters to Lord Kames throughout
‘the seventies,’ along with experimental investigations
in physics and physiology which show continued interest
in natural causes. A letter, written in 1775, contains a
curious conjecture with regard to the generation of plants
and animals, more speculative than was his habit. He is
‘apt to conjecture,’ he tells his friend, ‘that both plants
and animals are at first organised atoms, having all the
parts of the animal or plant, but so slender, and folded up
in such a manner, as to be reduced to a particle far beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the reach of our senses, and perhaps as small as the constituent
parts of water. The earth, the water, and the air
may, for anything I know, be full of such organised atoms.’
He then goes on to consider the relation of this hypothesis
to the idea of active design in nature, and expresses doubt
about the possibility of the atoms being endowed with power
to form themselves into an organised body like the human.
‘I cannot help thinking that such a work as the Iliad, and
much more an animal or vegetable body, must have been
made by express design. It seems to me as easy to contrive
a machine which should compose a variety of epic
poems and tragedies, as to contrive laws of motion by which
unthinking particles of matter should coalesce into a variety
of organised bodies.’ He suggests that the organisation is
the issue of constant and uniform divine activity. ‘Can
we,’ he asks, ‘show by any good reason that the Almighty
finished his work at a stroke, and has continued ever since
an inactive spectator? And if His continued operation be
necessary, it is no miracle, while it is uniform, and according
to fixed laws. Though we should suppose the gravitation
of matter to be the immediate operation of the Deity, it
would be no miracle while it is constant and uniform; but
if it should cease for a moment, only by His withholding
His hand, <em>this</em> would be a miracle.’ This is to say that all
natural changes are immediate effects of divine action,
proceeding according to natural law or rule.</p>

<p>The suggestion illustrates the bent of Reid’s thought in
later life. If our common sense of the continuous independent
existence of sensible things, and of their manifestation
in Perception as directly as states of our own
minds are manifested to us when we are conscious of
them—if <em>this</em> was the factor of the Common Sense that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
engaged him in New Machar and King’s College days, the
Power or Causality which all changes in the universe presuppose
now becomes prominent, alike in his correspondence
and in his books. What is meant by Power, and where is
the Power centred that is implied in the changes that are
always going on, in ourselves and in our surroundings?
Priestley’s assumption that matter explains all the phenomena
of a human mind; the theory of universal necessity
advocated by Kames; and the duties of his Glasgow professorship,
all tended to carry his reflections onward from the
merely physical to the ethical judgments of the common
sense, and so upward from the merely natural to the spiritual
interpretation of the universe. ‘First that which is natural,
then that which is spiritual.’</p>

<p>This runs through his correspondence with Lord Kames.
That there is no absolute necessity for men being bad;
that their immoral acts are centred and originate in
themselves and not in God; that it would be unjust
to exact as a duty what it is not in a person’s power to
do; that what a man does voluntarily or with deliberate
intention, it is also in his power not to do; that what
is done without his will is not really done by <em>him</em> at all;
and that real power is moral agency,—these are ultimate
judgments, reached ‘not by logical reasoning,’ but in ‘the
more trustworthy way of immediate perception and feeling,’
to which Reid so often appeals. ‘If I could suppose God
to make a devil a devil, I cannot suppose that He would
condemn him for being a devil,’ is in a letter to Lord Kames.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The impotence of matter rather than its independence
is now insisted on; with the inference that at any rate
<em>it</em> cannot cause our perceptions, as Priestley supposed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
He begins to see that power must be referred to mind
or spirit alone, and that matter is powerless. ‘Efficient
causes are not within the sphere of natural philosophy,
which is concerned only with the laws or methods according
to which Power operates. It exhibits the grand
machine of the material world, analysed, as it were, and
taken to pieces. It belongs to metaphysics and natural
theology to show the Power that continues and gives
motion to the whole; according to laws which the
naturalist discovers, and perhaps according to laws still
more general.’</p>

<p class="tb">It was thus that Reid’s uneventful life of thought—deep,
steady, unobtrusive—was sustained for sixteen years, when
he was educating the rising generation in the old class-room
at the College; unfolding philosophy in correspondence
with a sympathetic friend; contributing essays to the
Literary Society which met monthly at the College; and
preparing his ‘Brief Account’ of Aristotle—all until he
had reached his seventieth year. On the 19th of May
1780 he wrote to Lord Kames of a change that had
occurred the day before:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I find myself growing old; and I have no right lo plead
exemption from the infirmities of that stage of life. For that
reason I have made choice of an Assistant in my office.
Yesterday the College at my desire made choice of Mr.
Archibald Arthur, preacher, to be my assistant and successor.
I think I have done good service to the College by this, and
procured some leisure to myself, though with reduction of my
finances.’</p>

</div>

<p>It was Reid’s desire, while his faculties were yet vigorous,
to devote his strength to further philosophical authorship.
During the remaining sixteen years of his life his lectures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were delivered to the students by Mr. Arthur, to whom
the professorial work in the class-room was transferred.
Arthur, then thirty-six years of age, was a native of Renfrewshire,
a distinguished alumnus of Glasgow, as it seems from
a posthumous volume of his Essays, and a man not unlike
Reid in mind and character, but in inferior form; at this
time chaplain and librarian of the University, and a
member of the Literary Society. After one of Arthur’s
Sunday services in the College chapel, Reid had whispered
to one of his colleagues on the professorial bench—‘This
is a very sensible fellow, and in my opinion would make
a good professor of morals.’<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He is described by a contemporary
as ‘a man of unprepossessing exterior, of
invincible bashfulness, which continued to clog his manner
and impede his exertions during the whole course of his
life; but of a thoughtful, grave, silent habit, which led
him to a due estimate of what he was individually adapted
to.’ He survived Reid, as his successor, a little more than
a year, when he was followed in the Chair by James Mylne,
a strong man unknown in philosophical literature, whose
professorial career of forty years made him a familiar figure
to generations of Glasgow students.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">PHILOSOPHICAL RETIREMENT: AUTHORSHIP IN OLD AGE<br />1780-1795</span></h2>

<p>Dugald Stewart, when illustrating the changes in human
memory that are connected with disease and old age, refers
thus to Reid:—‘One old man I have myself had the good
fortune to know, who, after a long, an active, and an
honourable life, having begun to feel some of the usual
effects of advanced years, has been able to find resources
in his own sagacity against most of the inconveniences with
which they are commonly attended; and who, by watching
his gradual decline with the courage of an indifferent
observer, and employing his ingenuity to retard its progress,
has converted even the infirmities of old age into a source
of philosophical amusement.’ For sixteen years Reid had
been discharging that part of the duties of a professor
which belongs to the class-room: the remaining sixteen
years of his life, devoted to original research and authorship,
illustrate the words of Stewart. He continued, after the
appointment of Arthur, to live as before in the Professors’
Court in old Glasgow College—a placid, methodical life,
steadily industrious, a sagacious interpreter of nature and
of man, still active in the academic senate—with occasional
recreation in visits to the country. The year 1780 was
saddened by another of those domestic sorrows which
formed the chief interruption to the tranquil happiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his life; for his eldest son, George, died in Newfoundland
in February, at the age of twenty-five. Two years later
the only remaining son, David, was taken away; after
which his daughter, Mrs. Carmichael, alone survived of
the nine sons and daughters.</p>

<p>Very soon after he had been released from the public
work of the professorship, letters to his cousin, Dr. James
Gregory, then an Edinburgh Professor of Medicine, speak
of activity in transforming the lectures into the form of
philosophical essays for publication. This enterprise was
indeed Reid’s principal employment for the next eight
years. The <cite>Essays</cite> appeared in two instalments, in 1785
and 1788. The first instalment was a matter-of-fact inquiry
into the intellectual power of man; the second was a
matter-of-fact inquiry into man’s moral power: the ‘facts’
inquired about and appealed to were the invisible ones
of which men are conscious, not those that can be seen
and touched—above all, the final convictions of which
the Common Sense consists. Both instalments appeared
in the same decade of last century in which Kant’s
‘<cite>Kritiks</cite>’ of Pure and Practical Reason were given to
the world.</p>

<p>Reid’s <cite>Essays</cite> form, as it were, the inner court of the
temple of which the Aberdonian <cite>Inquiry</cite> is the vestibule.
But the vestibule is a more finished work of constructive
skill than the inner court, for the aged architect appears
at last as if embarrassed by accumulated material. The
<cite>Essays</cite>, greater in bulk, perhaps less deserve a place
among modern philosophical classics than the <cite>Inquiry</cite>,
notwithstanding its narrower scope, confined as it is to
man’s perception of the extended world, as an object-lesson
in the method of appeal to the common sense. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the <cite>Essays</cite> an advance is made towards a finally ethical
interpretation of man and the universe.</p>

<p>We have no longer the light of letters to Lord Kames
in this closing stage of Reid’s life; for Kames died in 1782.
Reid’s retiring modesty deprived him of that large literary
intercourse to which his philosophical position might otherwise
have led. His correspondence with men eminent
in letters or philosophy seems almost confined to Kames,
the Gregories, Dugald Stewart, and Dr. Price. I find no
trace of correspondence with his Aberdeen friends Campbell
and Beattie, whose pursuits had so much in common
with his own. But letters to Dr. James Gregory take the
place in the ‘eighties’ which those to Lord Kames took
in the ‘seventies’; they reveal an old age given to proof-sheets,
scientific experiments, and benignant interest in
social progress. One dated ‘Glasgow College, April 7,
1783,’ tells of the <cite>Essays on the Intellectual Powers</cite>
in the press:—‘I shall be much obliged if you will
continue to favour me with your observations; therefore I
have put off examining those you have sent until the
manuscripts be returned, which I expect about the end of
this month, along with Dugald Stewart’s observations.’
Again he writes in June:—‘I cannot get more copied of
my papers till next winter, and indeed have not much more
ready. This parcel goes to page 658. I believe what you
have got before may be one-half of all I intend. The
materials of what is not yet ready for the copier are partly
discourses read in our Literary Society, partly notes of my
lectures. Your judgment of what you have seen flatters
me very much, and adds greatly to my own opinion of it;
though authors seldom are deficient in a good opinion of
their works. I am at a loss to express my obligations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
you for the pains you have taken.’ He refers in another
letter to what he regards as the source of the fashionable
agnosticism against which his life was a continued
philosophical protest:—‘I have often thought of what you
propose—to give a History of the Ideal System and what
I have to say against it, <em>by itself</em>; and I am far from being
satisfied that it stands in the most proper place [in the
<cite>Essays</cite>]. I have endeavoured to put it in separate chapters
[<i>e.g.</i> Essay ii. ch. 7-15], whose titles may direct those who have
no taste for it to pass over them. I observe that Bayle
and others, who at the reformation of Natural Philosophy
gave new light, found it necessary to contrast their own
discoveries with the Aristotelian notions which then prevailed.
We may now wish their works purged of this
controversial part; but perhaps it was necessary at the
time they wrote, when men’s minds were full of the old
system, and prepossessed in its favour. What I take to
be the genuine Philosophy of the Human Mind is in so low
a state, and has so many enemies, that I apprehend those
who would make any improvement in it must, for some
time at least, build with one hand, and hold a weapon with
the other.’ So Reid claimed the office of modern reformer
of the philosophy of human mind, as Bacon and others had
been the reformers of the sciences which interpret external
nature.</p>

<p>On ‘March 14, 1784,’ he mentions the progress of the
book:—‘I send you now the remainder of what I propose
to print with respect to the Intellectual Powers of the Mind.
It may perhaps be a year before what relates to the Active
Powers be ready; and therefore I think the former might
be published by itself, as it is very uncertain whether I
shall live to publish the latter. I think the title may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<cite>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of the Human Mind</cite>.
It will easily divide into eight Essays; but with regard to
this, as well as whether the two parts may be published
separately, I wish to have your advice and Mr. Stewart’s.
I apprehend that the Second Part—I mean what relates
to the Active Powers—will not be near so large as the
First.’ On ‘2nd May 1785’ he announces that the
<cite>Essays on the Intellectual Powers</cite> are ready for publication,
dedicated to Dr. Gregory and to Dugald Stewart:—‘I send
you enclosed what I propose as the title of my <cite>Essays</cite>,
with an Epistle which I hope you and Mr. Stewart will
allow me to prefix to them. Whether your name should
go first, on account of your doctor’s degree, or Mr. Stewart’s,
I leave you to adjust between yourselves. I know not how
to express my obligations to you both, for the aid you have
given me.’</p>

<p>The book thus ushered into the world in 1785 treats of
those constituents of the common sense that are implied,
not only in perception of things through the five senses
and memory, but also in imagination and in the experimental
sciences that deal with the past, the distant,
and the future. One of them contains the rudiments of
a criticism of the common sense principles that finally
regulate all abstract reasonings, and above all, those that
determine our judgments of truths contingent upon Will—human
and divine; in all of which what philosophers
called ‘ideas’ seemed to him to spoil the genuine common
sense and its inspirations. The fifth Essay deals with the
office and relations of our abstract conceptions. Of this
Essay Schopenhauer remarks that ‘the best and most intelligent
exposition of the nature and essence of conceptions
which I have been able anywhere to find is in Thomas Reid’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<cite>Essays on the Powers of the Human Mind</cite>. This was
afterwards condemned by Dugald Stewart in his <cite>Philosophy
of the Human Mind</cite>. Not to waste paper, I will briefly
remark with regard to Stewart, that he belongs to that
large class who have obtained an undeserved reputation
through favour and friends, and therefore I can only
advise that not an hour should be wasted over the scribbling
of this shallow writer.’<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This unworthy criticism of
Stewart is far removed from the calm judgment of Reid.</p>

<p>That our perceptions are not related to their objects as
effects are related to their causes, is insisted on in the
<cite>Essays</cite>, in opposition to Priestley, who treats cognitive
acts as the issue of power which belongs to matter.
‘Men,’ Reid says, ‘have been prone to imagine that, as
bodies are put in motion by some impulse or impression
made upon them by contiguous bodies, so the mind is
made to think and perceive by some impression made upon
it by contiguous objects. But to say that an object which
I see with perfect indifference <em>makes an impression</em> upon
my mind is not good English. It is evident from the
manner in which this phrase is used by modern philosophers
that they mean, not barely to express by it my perceiving
an object, but to explain the manner of perception. They
think that the object perceived acts upon the mind in
some way similar to that in which one body acts upon
another. The impression upon the mind is conceived to
be something wherein the mind is altogether passive. But
this is a hypothesis which contradicts the common sense
of mankind. When I look upon the wall of my room, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
wall does not act at all, nor is capable of acting: the
perceiving it is an act or operation in me.’ In short, the
relation between perceptions and their objects is a unique
relation, not to be confounded with the causal, the only
causality involved being the percipient power that is in me.</p>

<p>Those <cite>Essays</cite> of Reid which treat of the constituents of
the common sense that are implied in the Intellect power of
man, appeared in the early summer of 1785. In September
he informed Dr. Gregory of the opinion of Dr. Price,
the most eminent contemporary English metaphysician:—‘I
had a letter from Dr. Price lately, thanking me for a copy
of the <cite>Essays</cite> I ordered to be presented to him; which he
has read, and calls a work of the first value; commends
me particularly for treating Dr. Priestley so gently, who,
he says, had been unhappily led to use me ill.’ He then
refers to his own health, which seems to have suffered from
the mental strain, now relieved by the issue of his book:—‘As
you are so kind as to ask me about my distemper, I
think it is almost quite gone, so as to give me no uneasiness.
I abstain from fruit and malt liquor, and take a
little port wine, mostly noon and night, not above two
bottles a week when alone. The more I walk or ride, or
even talk or read audibly, I am the better.’</p>

<p>Dr. Beattie writes thus to the Bishop of Chester in
October:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Has your lordship read Dr. Reid’s <cite>Essays on the Intellectual
Powers of Man</cite>? Those readers who have been conversant in
the modern philosophy of mind, as it appears in the writings
of Descartes, Malebranche, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, will
be much entertained with this work, which does great honour
to the sagacity and patience of the author. It contains the
principles of his <cite>Inquiry</cite>, laid down on a larger scale, and
applied to a greater variety of subjects. Dr. Reid treats his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
opponents and their tenets with a respect and a solemnity that
sometimes tempt me to smile. His style is clear and simple;
and his aversion to the word <em>idea</em> is so great, that I think he
never once uses it in delivering his own opinions. It was not
without reason that Stillingfleet took the alarm at Mr. Locke’s
indiscreet use of that word. It was indeed an <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>
that decoyed him in spite of his excellent understanding into
a thousand pits and quagmires. Berkeley it bewildered still
more. And it reduced David Hume to the condition of a
certain old gentleman of whom we read, that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">Fluttering his pinions vain,</div>
<div class="verse">Plumb down he dropped, ten thousand fathoms deep.’</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Whether our power of conceiving is so far a test of
possibility, as that what is distinctly conceived must be
concluded to be possible, and what cannot be conceived
impossible, was a question which interested Reid. It is
discussed in the <cite>Essays on the Intellectual Powers</cite>, and also
in the draft of a letter to Dr. Price, preserved among the
manuscripts at Birkwood; in which it is argued that our
power of conception cannot be a criterion of what is
possible. The argument turns much on the meanings of
‘conception,’ ‘possibility,’ and ‘impossibility.’ He thus
addresses Dr. Price:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I would willingly suggest some subject on which I might
have the favour of your thoughts when you have leisure and
are disposed for such correspondence. What occurs to my
thoughts just now is a metaphysical axiom very generally
adopted, and, I think, occasionally adopted by you in your
<cite>Review of the Principal Questions in Morals</cite>—That what we
distinctly conceive is possible. From this axiom D. Hume
infers that it is possible that an universe may start into existence
without a cause, and other like extravagancies. The use
he makes of it led me to consider it a good many years ago,
and I have a strong suspicion that there is some fallacy in it,
which has imposed on men’s understandings, owing to the
ambiguity of the word <em>conceive</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>‘As to the history of this axiom, I suspect it to have taken
its rise from what Descartes laid down as the criterion of truth,
which he maintained to be clear and distinct conception.
<i lang="la">Quidquid clare et distincte concipio esse verum, id est verum.</i>
Cudworth seems to have followed him in this, making the
criterion of verity to be clear, self-consistent intelligibility.
Those who came after, judging it difficult to maintain that
everything is <em>true</em> which is clearly conceivable or intelligible,
have maintained that everything that can be clearly conceived
is at least <em>possible</em>. This seemed to be the proper correction
of Descartes’ maxim, and it has passed from one hand to
another without strict examination.</p>

<p>‘Whatever is true or false, whatever is possible or impossible,
may be expressed by a proposition. Now, what do we mean
when we say that we conceive a proposition? I think no more
is meant, if we speak properly, than that we understand what
is meant by that proposition. If this be so, it must surely be
granted that we may understand the meaning of a proposition
which expresses what is impossible. He who understands the
meaning of this proposition, “Two and two make four,” must
equally understand the meaning of this other, “Two and two
do not make four.” Both are equally understood; that is, the
conception of both is equally clear; yet the first is necessarily
true, and the second impossible.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it will be said, that we may not merely conceive
the <em>meaning</em> of a proposition, but we may conceive it to be a
<em>true</em> proposition, and that it is our being able to conceive it to
be true that gives us ground to think it possible. In answer to
this, I beg you would attend very carefully to the meaning of
these words—“Conceiving a proposition to be true.” I can
put no other meaning upon them but judging it to be true, that
is, giving some degree of assent to it. Judgment or assent
admits of various degrees, from the slightest suspicion to the
most deliberate conviction; from the most modest and diffident
assent to the most pertinacious and dogmatical. I conceive
there maybe inhabitants in the moon; that is, my judgment
leans a little that way. I would not use that expression unless
the probability, however small, seemed to be on that side of
the question.</p>

<p>‘If this be the meaning of conceiving a proposition to be
true, then the meaning of the axiom will be, that a proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which appears to us to have any degree of probability, however
small, must at least be possible. But the axiom, taken in this
sense, is surely false. It would be superfluous to give instances
of this to a mathematician.</p>

<p>‘If it should be said that conceiving a proposition to be true
means, neither barely to understand the meaning of the proposition,
nor the giving any degree of assent to it, I would be
glad to know what it really does mean. For I am at a loss
to know what power of the understanding we mean by the
conceiving a proposition to be true, if it is neither simple
apprehension, by which we barely understand the meaning of
a proposition, nor judgment, by which we assent to the proposition
or dissent from it. I know of no power of the understanding
intermediate between these two. And if there is
none, I think the axiom must be false.</p>

<p>‘There are many propositions which, by the faculties God
has given us, we perceive to be not only true, but necessarily
true; and the contradictions of these must be impossible. So
that our knowledge of what is impossible keeps pace with our
knowledge of necessary truth.</p>

<p>‘By our senses and our memory, by testimony and other
means, we have the certain knowledge of many truths which
we do not perceive to be necessary; their contraries therefore
may be possible for aught we know. But we know that
whatever is true, whether necessary or not, is possible. Our
knowledge therefore of what is possible keeps pace with our
knowledge of truth, whether contingent or necessary. Beyond
this, I am afraid our knowledge of what is possible is conjectural.
And although we are apt to think everything to be
possible which we do not perceive to be impossible, yet in this
we may be greatly deceived. You know well, sir, that mathematics
affords many instances of impossibilities <em>in the nature
of things</em>, which no man would have dreamed of or believed,
until they were discovered by accurate and subtle reasoning.
Perhaps if we were able to reason demonstratively to as great
an extent in other subjects as in mathematics, we might
discover many things to be impossible which we now take to
be possible. We are apt to think it possible that God might
have made an universe of sensible and rational creatures, into
which neither natural nor moral Evil should ever enter. It
may be so for what I know. But how are you certain that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
is possible? I can distinctly conceive it, say you; therefore it
is possible. I do not admit this argument. May not a man
who is a mathematician as distinctly conceive that in the
infinite variety of numbers gradually ascending, there is no
ratio whatsoever which is not equal to the ratio of some one
whole number to some other whole number? Yet the mathematician
can demonstrate that there are innumerable ratios
which are not equal to the ratio of some one number to another.
Many mathematicians, taking it for granted that it was possible
to square the circle, have spent their lives in a fruitless pursuit.
May not our taking things to be possible, in matters of higher
moment, when we can show no good reason that they are so,
lead us into unnecessary disputes and vain theories? Ought
we to admit that as a just argument in reasoning, or even as a
pressing difficulty, which is grounded on the supposition that
such a thing is possible, when in reality we have no good
evidence of its being possible, and for anything we can show
to the contrary, it may be impossible?’</p>

</div>

<p>A letter to Dr. Gregory in March 1786 shows the
<cite>Essays on the Active or Moral Powers</cite> in the press:—‘I am
proud of the approbation you express of the <cite>Essays</cite>. I
have made some corrections and additions, but such as I
hope will not make it necessary to write the book over
again. But I wish, if I find health and leisure in summer,
to add some Essays to go before that on “Liberty of the
Will,” in order to give some further elucidation of the
principles of morals. I expect your remarks and D.
Stewart’s on what is in hand. It will be no inconvenience
to wait two, three, or even four months.’ Two years later,
early in 1788, when he was in his seventy-eighth year,
the five <cite>Essays on the Active Powers of Man</cite> were published.
This was Reid’s last appearance as a philosophical
author. The eight Essays of 1785, and the five Essays of
1788, all relate to human Power—power immanent or
intellectual, and power overtly operative or moral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In March, a few weeks after the book appeared, Beattie
writes to Sir W. Forbes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I have been looking into Dr. Reid’s book on <cite>The Active
Powers of Man</cite>. It is written with his usual perspicuity and
acuteness; is in some parts very entertaining; and to me, who
have been obliged to think much on those subjects, is very
interesting throughout. The question concerning Liberty and
Necessity [of the Will] is very fully discussed, and very ably,
and I think nothing more need be said about it. I could
have wished that he had given a fuller examination of the
passions, and been a little more practical in illustrating the
duties of morality. But his manner in all his writings more
turned to speculative than to practical philosophy; which may
be owing to his having employed himself so much in the study
of Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and other theorists; and partly, no
doubt, to the habits of study and modes of conversation which
were fashionable in this country in his younger days. If I were
not personally acquainted with the Doctor, I should conclude
from his books that he was rather too warm an admirer of
Mr. Hume. He confutes, it is true, some of his opinions; but
pays them much more respect than they are entitled to.’</p>

</div>

<p>To Beattie’s less profound intelligence, indignant sentiment
was more acceptable, in defence of fundamental faith,
than the calm inquiry and sympathetic criticism of Reid.</p>

<p>The Literary Society which met monthly in the College
was occasionally a channel for his thoughts through all the
years of the Glasgow professorship, as the more famous
‘Wise Club’ had been at Aberdeen. Principal Leechman,
Black, Moor, Arthur, and Dr. Thomas Hamilton were also
members. Some of Reid’s contributions before 1788 seem
to have been incorporated in the <cite>Essays</cite>. After that he
still found vent for his thoughts in papers for the Society,
and in letters to Dr. Gregory, chiefly about Power and
Causation. Among the most important of those submitted
to the Society in his last years, I find ‘Some Observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
on the Modern System of Materialism,’ in which the impotence
of matter is maintained; as also in another, entitled
‘Miscellaneous Reflections on Priestley’s account of Hartley’s
Theory of the Human Mind.’ Then we have ‘Observations
on the Utopia of Sir Thomas More.’ A short essay
‘On Power,’<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in March 1792, was his last metaphysical
performance: it sums up his conclusions regarding our
conception of causation, as regulated by the Common Sense.
‘Observations on the Danger of Political Innovation,’
suggested by the Revolution in France, were read in the
Society on November 1794.</p>

<p>This last Essay is characteristic. It presses a distinction
between two political attitudes that are apt to be confounded—the
one speculative, dealing with abstractions,
treating the facts of the case and history as irrelevant; the
other practical, taking account of the actual conditions,
therefore disposed to modify its ideals by a due regard to
what has been and now is. The first asks what that
organisation of society is, which, abstractly considered, is
most favourable to progress: the other cautiously considers
how the inherited political organism may with least friction
be adapted to the changed conditions of the social evolution.
Reid assumes this last as his attitude, arguing that
the British Constitution encourages continuous orderly
evolution, not sudden revolution, and that this is illustrated
in its history since 1688. At first, he had looked with
sanguine hope to the French Revolution, but, like Edmund
Burke, who shortly before had been Rector of Glasgow
University, his hope gave place to fear. It is interesting that
it was the <cite>Vindiciæ Gallicæ</cite> of Sir James Mackintosh that had
inspired him with the hope; for, according to his daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Mrs. Carmichael, he was struck with admiration on reading
the book, and used often to speak of it as one of the most
ingenious essays in political philosophy he had ever met with.</p>

<p>Jeremy Bentham as well as Mackintosh was known to
Reid by his writings, as appears in this letter to Dr. Gregory,
in September 1788, which refers to Bentham’s <cite>Defence of
Usury</cite>, published the year before:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I am much pleased with the tract you sent me on Usury.
I think the reasoning unanswerable, and have long been of the
author’s opinion, though I suspect that the general principle—that
bargains ought to be left to the judgment of the parties,
may admit of some exceptions; when the buyers are the many,
the poor, the simple, and the sellers few, rich, and cunning.
The former may need the aid of the magistrate to prevent their
being oppressed by the latter. It seems to be upon this principle
that postage, freight, the hire of chairs and coaches, and the
price of bread, are regulated in most great towns. But with
regard to the loan of money in a commercial state, the exception
can have no place—the borrowers and lenders are upon
an equal footing, and each may be left to take care of his
own interest.’</p>

</div>

<p>Three years before his death Reid is found preparing
the <cite>Account of the University of Glasgow</cite>, which appeared
three years after his death, in the <cite>Statistical Account of
Scotland</cite> published by Sir John Sinclair. It was not communicated
by him to Sir John, but transmitted by Professor
Jardine, in name of the Principal and Professors, at whose
request Reid seems to have engaged in this work. It was
an anonymous publication, but it has been attributed to
him, and it bears internal evidence of his hand. His
colleague, Professor Richardson, in his biographical account
of Professor Arthur, Reid’s successor, published in 1803,
mentions that ‘the Statistical Account of the University was
all written by Dr. Reid, except the statements respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the business of particular classes.’ It shows intelligence
then uncommon in Scotland of the mediæval constitution
of Universities, and appreciation of the true academical
ideal. The life begun at King’s College forty years before
in projects of University reform, was fitly closed by this
account of the great western seat of learning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reid died early in 1792. His feelings were thus
expressed in a letter to Dugald Stewart:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘By the loss of my bosom friend, with whom I lived fifty-two
years, I am brought into a kind of new world, at a time of life
when old habits are not easily forgot, or new ones acquired.
But every world is God’s world, and I am thankful for the
comforts He has left me. Mrs. Carmichael has now the care of
two deaf old men, and does everything in her power to please
them; and both are very sensible of her goodness. I have
more health than at my time of life [82] I had any reason to
expect. I walk about; entertain myself with reading what I
soon forget; I can converse with one person if he articulates
distinctly and within ten inches of my left ear; I go to church
without hearing a word of what is said. You know I had never
any pretensions to vivacity, but I am still free from languor
and <i lang="fr">ennui</i>.’</p>

</div>

<p>After this sorrow, his daughter, Mrs. Carmichael, lived
much in his house in the Professors’ Court. She became
a widow in the same year, for her husband died a few
months after Mrs. Reid. Elizabeth Leslie, daughter of his
stepsister Margaret, was also an inmate, and added to
the comfort of the closing years. Soon after her father’s
death Mrs. Carmichael went to live at Aberdeen.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">INSPIRED COMMON SENSE AND CAUSATION: ACTIVE OR
MORAL POWER IN MAN</span></h2>

<p>Philosophical recognition of the genuine Common Sense
or natural judgment of mankind, especially in two of its
factors, which seemed to Reid obscured if not suppressed
by dogmatic hypothesis, gave its character to his whole
intellectual life. He found, in the first place, that ‘all philosophers;
from Plato to Mr. Hume, agree in this, that we
do not perceive external objects immediately, and that
the immediate object of perception must be some image
present to the mind.’ To rid philosophy of this hypothesis,
as a mere prejudice, inconsistent with the absolute trustworthiness,
and therefore with the supreme and final
rational authority of our natural judgment, was the chief
aim of his Aberdonian life—culminating in the <cite>Inquiry</cite> in
1764. He found, in the second place, that ‘to confound
the notion of agent or efficient cause with that of physical
cause has been a common error of philosophers, from the
days of Plato to our own’; and it seemed to him as subversive
of moral relations in the universe as the other
was of physical relations. Accordingly, our conception of
Power or Causation chiefly engaged him in Glasgow.
This appears in his ‘Essays’ on moral Power in man;
in his correspondence with Kames and Gregory in the last
twenty years of his life; as well as in the unpublished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fragment on ‘Power,’ in 1792, which was his last expression
of reflective thought. The Philosophy of Perception and
the Philosophy of Causation—our common sense of extended
reality in our first intercourse with it in the senses,
and our common sense conception of ‘power’ and ‘cause’
which arises in the presence of the changes amidst which
we live and have our being—these were the two poles of
Reid’s philosophical life. His whole life was a war against
two common errors of philosophers regarding these, from
the days of Plato to our own, in each of which the seeds
of speculative and practical scepticism seemed to lie
thickly. If these two fundamental convictions were untrustworthy,
then faith in anything must lose its sustaining
strength. For our perceptions through the five senses are the
first principles of all our reasonings about the actual universe,
and our causal judgments are the means of interpreting the
realities to which those perceptions only introduce us.</p>

<p>We find ourselves continually in contact and collision
with Power that is external to ourselves individually; and
we seem, too, to be exerting powers of our own: on the
Power latent in the universe, our happiness or misery, our
whole destiny, depends. What does all this mean? What
is meant by the judgment that all changes in the universe
are ‘caused’; and what is the origin of this judgment, or
of the conception of ‘cause’ that is involved in it? Are
the powers which we recognise in us and around us to be
referred only to inanimate things as their centres; or only
to living and self-conscious persons; or to both?</p>

<p>Priestley, as an advocate of the claim of matter to
account sufficiently for self-conscious life in man, and
Kames and Priestley by their universal necessity, confirmed
Reid’s disposition to inquire further into the nature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
origin of the conception of power, and the judgment that
every change presupposes what we ambiguously call a
cause. His cousin Gregory, too, inquired about causation,
and gave the results to the world in an <cite>Essay on the
Difference between the Relation of Motive and Action, and
that of Cause and Effect in Physics</cite>, which appeared in 1792.</p>

<p>That every change must be caused, Reid regarded as a
postulate of which the contradictory was absolutely inconceivable:
it was necessarily implied in the common rational
sense of Man, and, while incapable of logical proof, was
that without which nothing else could be proved. That the
things presented to our senses are themselves powerless;
that all power is spiritual, referable only to Will; and
that this is the common sense implicate of our physical
and moral experience of changes, was the proposition which
Reid now set himself to justify. Our experience of our
own voluntary exertion is the only experience which directs
us to the quarter in which power, properly so called, resides.
A voluntary agent is our only example of a cause, or of
that to which change must be finally referred as its responsible
source. We can find no productive power in
any inanimate thing. Matter, instead of being the universal
cause, is in itself powerless, and can account for nothing.
The material universe is virtually an external system of
interpretable signs, regulated by non-material power.</p>

<p>Take the following extracts from various letters of Reid’s
to Gregory, from 1785 onwards,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in the unpublished paper
on Power:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Power to produce an effect supposes power not to produce
it; otherwise it is not power but necessity, which is incompatible
with power taken in a strict sense.... I am not able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to form a conception how power (in the strict sense) can be
exerted without will; nor can there be will without some
degree of understanding. Therefore nothing can be an
efficient cause in the proper sense but an intelligent being
[<i>i.e.</i> a person]. Hence the only notion we can form of Almighty
Power is, that God can do whatever He wills. Matter cannot
be the cause of anything: it can only be an instrument in the
hands of a real cause.... In physics the word cause has
another meaning, which, though I think it an improper one,
yet is distinct, and therefore may be reasoned upon. When a
phenomenon is produced according to a certain law of nature,
we call the law [or rule] the <em>cause</em> of that phenomenon; and
to the laws or rules of nature we accordingly ascribe power
or efficiency. The whole business of physics is to discover, by
observation and experiment, the laws of nature, and to apply
them to the solution of phenomena. Now a law of nature is a
purpose or resolution of the Author of nature to act according
to a certain rule. There must be a real agent to produce the
phenomenon according to the law. A malefactor is not hanged
by the law, but by the executioner according to the law.’</p>

<p>Again:—‘A cause in the proper and strict sense signifies a
<em>mind</em> that has power and will to produce the effect. A cause
in the physical sense means only something which, by the laws
of nature, the effect always follows; as when we say that heat
is the cause that turns water into vapour.... Between a
physical cause and its effect the conjunction must be constant;
unless in the case of a miracle. What D. Hume says of causes
in general is very just when applied to physical causes—that a
constant conjunction with the effect is essential to such causes,
and implied in the very conception of them.’ Again:—‘I wish
that the same general name—cause—had not been given to
both. They differ <i lang="la">toto genere</i>. For a physical cause is not an
agent. It does not act, but is acted upon. <em>You</em> accordingly
give them different names; calling the one the agent and not
the cause, the other the cause and not the agent. But I think
this too bold an innovation in language. Men have been so
much accustomed to call the Deity the First Cause of things,
that to maintain that He is no cause at all would be too
shocking. To say that the world exists <em>without a cause</em> would
be accounted atheism, in spite of all explanations.... The
words agent and action are less ambiguous. We say one <em>body</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
acts upon another; and in vain would one attempt to abolish
this language. To remedy this ambiguity of “cause” and
“agent,” I say that each of these words has two meanings—a
lax or popular and a philosophical.... It is remarkable
that the philosophical meaning must have been the first,
and the popular a corruption introduced by time.... Power
is first conceived from being conscious of it in ourselves. Conceiving
of inanimate beings from what we are conscious of in
ourselves, we at first ascribed to them such power as we are
conscious of, till experience informs us that inanimate things
have not the same powers as we have; but language was formed
before this discovery was made.... It is a curious question
how we come by the cognition of power and cause, so that we
ascribe them to things that have no will nor intelligence. I am
apt to think that savages, whenever they see motion which they
cannot account for, there they suppose a soul. In this period
of society language is formed. At length the more acute and
speculative few discover that some of the things which the
vulgar believe to be animated are inanimate. What use must
wise men make of this discovery? Will they affirm that the
sun does not shine nor give heat? that the sea never rages
nor the winds blow? nor the earth bring forth grass and corn?
The wiser part will speak the common language, and suit it to
their new notions as well as they can; just as philosophers
still say with the vulgar, that the sun “rises” and “sets.”’</p>

</div>

<p>That morally responsible intending Will is our ultimate
conception of Power or Cause, properly so called, is not
less the lesson of the Birkwood manuscript ‘On Power’
of 1792. Thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Will is necessarily implied in the notion of Power. Volition
and what naturally follows upon our volitions, is all that we
conceive to be in our own power. What a man never willed
can never be imputed to him as his action. A being that has
no will can have no power. When we impute powers to dead
matter, it must be in some popular or analogical sense, but not
in the proper sense. There can be no productive power in an
inanimate object.... A cause is that which has power to
produce an effect. When we ascribe power to things inanimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as causes, we mean nothing more than a constant conjunction
by the laws or rules of nature, which experience discovers.
Thus we say that the sun has power to retain the planets
in their orbits, and that heat has power to melt lead. If the
ignorant be led by the ambiguity of the word to conceive
power in the sun or in heat to produce the effects attributed
to them, this is a vulgar error which philosophy [<i>i.e.</i> of common
sense] corrects. By what agents these effects are [immediately]
produced we know not; but we have good reason to believe
that they cannot be produced by inanimate matter.’</p>

</div>

<p>Reid also allows that, for anything we can tell, things
which have no proper power of their own may be terms
in a sequence that is subject to an <em>absolute</em> necessity of
being the sequence that it is. But however this may be,
it transcends our knowledge; we must be satisfied with
the common sense conviction of persistent uniformities in
fact pervading the universe of change, whether this fact is
the result of a divine necessity or of arbitrary divine will.
Natural uniformities are presupposed in all our reasoning
about our natural surroundings, and without this presupposition
things could not be reasoned about or formed
into science. All our knowledge of natural events, beyond
original perceptions of sense, consists in interpretation of
the phenomena of which the senses make us aware. Upon
this judgment of the common sense our inductions are all
grounded, so that it may be called the inductive principle.
Withdraw trust from it and experience becomes blind as a
mole. We may <em>feel</em> what is present at the moment, but the
distant and the future are wholly hid in darkness.</p>

<p>Power or intelligent agency is thus the exclusive characteristic
of conscious persons: interpretable order is the
characteristic of inanimate things. These are two correlative
judgments or inspirations of our natural common sense upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which human reasonings turn. Reid finds when he reflects
patiently that he is obliged, by a rational instinct as it
were, to recognise himself and other persons as the centres
of responsible power, the only sort of power or causality in
existence that can be supposed by us; and also to recognise
in the impersonal world without, something that in itself is
passive and impotent, but which, as a system of interpretable
sense signs, may be said metaphorically to form the <em>language</em>
of nature, of which the natural sciences are (so far) the
interpretation. The universe is thus a material order
directed by spiritual power, in a measure corresponding to
the body and the spirit in man, as man now is. But this
larger conception carries us beyond the modest philosophy
to which Reid confined himself; although he more than
once approached it, perhaps through some unconscious
reminiscence of the Berkeleyism of his youth, of which, I
think, he failed to see the real drift, as it was unfolded in
<cite>Alciphron</cite> and especially in <cite>Siris</cite>.</p>

<p>Yet the following scrap, which I find among unpublished
manuscripts of his later life, shows that such
thoughts were not quite absent from his mind:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The ancient philosophers called God the Soul of the World.
This, considered as a figurative expression, is destitute neither
of beauty nor of truth. What the soul of man is to his body,
that God is to the universe, in several respects; but not in all.
There are many respects in which the metaphor fails: (1) The
human soul did not make its own body, but God made the
world; (2) the human soul is ignorant of the nice texture and
mechanism of its body, but God knows the whole mechanism
of the universe, because He conceived and made it; (3) the
human soul receives much of its information by bodily organs:
God’s knowledge of all things is immediate and not dependent
on bodily organs; (4) our power over our own bodies is limited:
the power of God over the universe is unlimited; (5) our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bodies are wholly made up of inert and soulless matter: the
universe is stored with various orders of living beings and free
agents, subject to the Divine Power as their moral governor
and capable of paying back the service of rational subjects.’</p>

</div>

<p>But the philosophy of the Common Sense, as represented
by Reid, did not rise to the conciliation of the natural
order of the material with the originative freedom of the
spiritual world, in which operating law in outward nature
is recognised as immediate divine agency, or a part of a
revelation of perfectly reasonable Will in and through a
universe of things and persons.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE END—1796</span></h2>

<p>In the last winter of his life Reid read an interesting discourse
on ‘Muscular Motion,’ in the Literary Society, of
which he so long had been a member. After describing
articulately the progressive changes in the human muscles
which mark the advance of age, and proposing an explanation,
he thus concludes his last public discourse:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘May I be permitted to mention that it was my own experience
of some of these effects of old age on the muscular
motions that led my thoughts to this explanation, which, as it
is owing to the infirmities of age, will, I hope, be treated with
the greater indulgence. It is both pleasant and useful to contemplate
with gratitude the wisdom and goodness of the Author
of our being, in fitting this machine of our body to the various
employments and enjoyments of life. The structure is admirable
as far as we are permitted to see it in this infancy of our
being. And the internal structure which is behind the veil
that limits our understanding, and which gives motion to the
whole, is, in a manner most wonderful, though unknown to us,
made subservient to our volition and efforts. This grand work
of nature, like the fruits of the earth, has its maturity, its decay,
and its dissolution. Like those also, in all its decay it
nourishes a principle within which is to be the seed of a
future existence. Were the fruit conscious of this, it would
drop into the earth with pleasure, in the hope of a happy
Resurrection. This hope, by the mercy of God, is given to all
good men. It is the consolation of old age, and more than
sufficient to make its infirmities sit light.’</p>

</div>

<p>The dissolution of the material organism which for eighty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
years had served the writer of these words was now near.
Of his few early philosophical associates, Campbell and
Beattie only were alive at the beginning of 1796, and in
April of that year Campbell died. Reid followed him
six months later. Dugald Stewart, then Professor of
Moral Philosophy in Edinburgh, gives the following account
of the months before the end:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In the summer of 1796, about two years after the death of
his wife, he was prevailed on by Dr. Gregory to pass a few
weeks at Edinburgh. He was accompanied by Mrs. Carmichael,
who lived with him in Dr. Gregory’s house, a situation
which united under the same roof every advantage of medical
care, of tender attachment, and of philosophical intercourse.
As Dr. Gregory’s professional engagements necessarily interfered
with his attentions to his guests, I enjoyed more of Dr.
Reid’s society than might otherwise have fallen to my share. I
had the pleasure, accordingly, of spending some hours with
him daily, and of attending him in his walking excursions,
which frequently extended to the distance of three or four
miles. His faculties (excepting his memory, which was considerably
impaired) appeared as vigorous as ever; and,
although his deafness prevented him from taking any share in
general conversation, he was still able to enjoy the company of
a friend. Mr. Playfair and myself were both witnesses of the
acuteness which he displayed on one occasion, in detecting a
mistake, by no means obvious, in a manuscript of his kinsman,
David Gregory, on the subject of “Prime and Ultimate
Ratios.” In apparent soundness and activity of body, he
resembled more a man of sixty than of eighty-seven. He
returned to Glasgow in his usual health and spirits; and continued
for some weeks to devote as formerly a regular portion
of his time to the exercise both of body and mind. It appears
from a letter of Dr. Cleghorn’s to Dr. Gregory, that he was
still able to work with his own hands in his garden; and he
was found by Dr. Brown occupied in the solution of an
algebraical problem of considerable difficulty, in which, after
the labour of a day or two, he at last succeeded.’</p>

</div>

<p>It was thus in summer. In September he was attacked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a violent disorder, and after a severe struggle, attended with
repeated strokes of palsy, he passed away on the 7th of
October. Thus ended the tranquil life of deep and patient
thought, which opened at Strachan and almost spanned the
eighteenth century, morally and intellectually the representative
of Scottish philosophical restoration under the
conditions of the time. His ashes were laid in the College
Church burial-ground, within the shadow of the College
of which he had so long been the chief ornament, and
under a tombstone bearing this inscription:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Memoriæ sacrum <span class="smcap">Thomæ Reid</span>, S.T.D., quondam in
Schola Regia Aberdonensi Philosophiæ Professoris; nuper
vero in Universitate Glasguensi, ab anno 1764 usque ad
annum 1796, Philosophiæ Moralis Professoris; qui in Scientia
Mentis Humanæ, ut olim in Philosophia Naturali illustris ille
Baconius Verulamius, omnia instauravit; qui ingenii acumine
doctrinæque omnigenæ, summam morum gravitatem, simul
atque comitatem, adjuvavit; qui obiit 7° October, 1796, annos
natus 86. Cujusque ossa cum cineribus <span class="smcap">Elizebethæ Reid</span>,
conjugis carissimæ, triumque filiarum morte prematura abrepturam,
sepulchro condita sunt. Hoc Monumentum poni jussit
filia piissima, unica superstes, Martha Carmichael.’</p>

</div>

<p>After the University of Glasgow had in 1872 exchanged
the College in the High Street, with its touching memories,
for its new and stately home on the bank of the Kelvin,
Reid’s remains were carried to the Necropolis which overlooks
his old home in the Drygate, and the tombstone was
removed to the College on Gilmore Hill.</p>

<p>I find Reid’s will, dated 7th May 1792, recorded in the
Sheriff-Court Books of Lanarkshire. Dr. and Mrs. Carmichael
are executors, with Mr. Leslie and Mr. Rose
conjoined. Furniture, books, and papers are left to Mrs.
Carmichael, except a few books for the University Library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Of the rest of the property, personal and real—after payment
of debts, including £300 to Dr. Carmichael, ‘payable
in full of my daughter’s tocher,’ and ‘£300 to John Sargent,
London, cousin-german of the dearest Elizabeth Reid, my
wife’—one half is assigned to Mrs. Carmichael, and the
other half, in equal portions, to ‘my sisters, Mrs. Leslie
and Mrs. Rose,’ burdened with ‘a liferent annuity of £10,
to my stepmother, Janet Fraser, widow of Mr. Lewis Reid.’
The real property is described as consisting of ‘eleven and
a half falls of ground, with the whole houses thereon, and
the well therein, bounded on the west by William Street,
on the north by the property of Dr. Carmichael, on the
south by the property of Joseph Crombie, and on the east
by the property of John Duguid and Wm. Risk, all in
the Barony parish.’ This property appears to have been
bought about 1780, the year in which Reid ceased to teach
in the College.</p>

<p class="tb">That this life, much withdrawn from the public eye in the
interest of philosophic reflection, was not unappreciated
when it ended, is shown by the recognition which immediately
followed. On the day after he died the event
was thus announced in the <cite>Glasgow Courier</cite>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Thomas Reid, D.D., Professor of Moral Philosophy in the
University of Glasgow, died on the seventh day of October.
His ingenious and elaborate works, especially his <cite>Inquiry into
the Human Mind</cite>, and his <cite>Essays on the Intellectual and
the Active Powers of Man</cite>, are noble and lasting monuments
of his eminent abilities, his deep penetration, and his extensive
learning. By unravelling sceptical perplexities, overturning ill-founded
hypotheses, and resting every conclusion on evident
principles, he has brought about a memorable revolution in the
Philosophy of Human Nature. His character through life was
distinguished by an ardent love of truth, and an assiduous pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of it in various sciences; by the most amiable simplicity
of manners, gentleness of temper, strength of affection, candour,
and liberality of sentiments, which displayed themselves in the
habitual exercise of all the social virtues; and by steadiness,
fortitude, and rational piety.’</p>

</div>

<p>A few days later a more elaborate study of his character
appeared in the <cite>Courier</cite>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Dr. Reid was unquestionably one of the profoundest
philosophers of the age; and although some who think it a
proof of weakness to differ from Mr. Hume have slighted the
speculations of Dr. Reid, and undervalued the precision
which he laboured to introduce, his Inquiry into the Senses
will probably be coeval with our language. It is founded on
facts which must continue to interest men while their constitution
continues unchanged. In his pursuit of new knowledge
he studied the late improvements in chemistry; he observed
the great political events which have happened, and contemplated
that with which the time seems pregnant with the keen
interest of one entering on life. He venerated religion—not the
noisy, contentious systems which lead men to hate and persecute
each other, but the sublime principle which regulates the conduct,
by controuling the selfish and animating the benevolent
affections. When vilified by intemperate philosophers [<i>e.g.</i>
Priestley], he made no reply, being satisfied with having stated
what he thought the truth; and when outraged by zealots who
falsely call themselves Christians, he bore the outrage meekly,
using no terms of complaint or reproach. He was to the last
moment free from that morose querulous temper which has
been deemed inseparable from age. Instead of repining at
the prosperity and enjoyments of the young, he delighted in
promoting them; and after having lost all his own family except
one daughter, he continued to treat children with such condescension
and benignity that some very young ones noticed the
peculiar kindness of his eye. His end accorded with the
wisdom and goodness of his life. He used sometimes to say,
“I am ashamed of having lived so long after having ceased to
be useful,” though at that very time he was acquiring and communicating
useful knowledge. During his last illness, which
was severe, he complained of nothing but the trouble that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
gave his affectionate family, and he looked to the grave as a
place not of rest merely but of triumph.’</p>

</div>

<p>The affectionate judgment of his contemporaries, in the
first days of sorrow, instead of exceeding, fall short of the
deliberate judgment of leaders of European thought in
a later generation. The rise of his reputation was slow.
As there are too many who make themselves appear more
wise than they are, it was the more uncommon fault of
Reid to appear less a philosopher than he really was.
Extreme caution made him suspicious of ingenious conjecture
in matter-of-fact inquiry, and perhaps blinded him
to the large part which imagination as well as reason
has to play in progress. ‘It is genius, and not the want
of it,’ he says, ‘that adulterates philosophy, and fills it
with error and false theory’; and in the spirit of this
warning, as well as by temperament, he was intellectually
conservative more than progressive or adventurous.</p>

<p>In outward appearance he was somewhat under the
middle size, with a bodily constitution of uncommon strength
and tenacity, maintained by a methodically regulated life
and habitual serenity of temper. Raeburn’s picture, now
in Fyvie Castle, for which he sat during his last visit to
Edinburgh, expresses the deep and persistent thought, as
well as the reposeful and benevolent temper, which gave
unity to his long life. Copies of this picture are preserved
at Birkwood, in the College of Glasgow, and in the
National Portrait Gallery at Edinburgh, as well as in the
great window of the Mitchell Hall of Marischal College.
There is also an excellent medallion by Tassie, done six
years before Reid’s death.</p>

<p>After the death of Mrs. Carmichael, in February 1805,
all who were descended of the Rev. Lewis Reid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Strachan, by his wife Margaret Gregory, had passed away.
His second wife and widow died at Aberdeen in 1798, like
her stepson, in her eighty-seventh year, having survived
him about eighteen months. The great-granddaughter of
Mrs. Leslie his half-sister, Grace Anna Leslie, now of
Birkwood, married Dr. Ross Paterson in 1864. Their
youngest daughter has charge of the Reid family papers, to
which I owe many facts first published in these pages. A
son of his other half-sister, Mrs. Rose, a medical officer in
the Indian army, was introduced in 1805 to Sir James
Mackintosh, then Recorder of Bombay, by Professor Ogilvie
of Aberdeen, as a relative of the advocate of the final
philosophical appeal to the Common Sense; and Mackintosh
in a letter to Mr. Ogilvie expresses the deep interest with
which he saw ‘the nephew of Dr. Reid, whose philosophy,
like you, I do not embrace, but whose character and talents
every cultivator of science must venerate.’ Sir James’s later
judgments of the philosophy, after a more attentive study
of its scope, were more favourable.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">RETROSPECTIVE AND CRITICAL</span></h2>

<p>We find truth, as Pascal says, not only by logical reasoning
but by an act of immediate reason, not to be effaced by
all the subtleties of the speculative sceptic, who is thus
confounded by the resistance of rational human nature.
This is a general expression of Reid’s more elaborate
reply to sceptical distrust in all human knowledge and
belief. That genuine human nature, when awakened
into conscious life, is practically irresistible, is what Reid
insists on; for no sane man acts in contradiction to the
common sense of which he is conscious, although he can
speculate sceptically in an abstract way, and may even
serve truth in doing so. For this scepticism may amend
philosophical systems in which the constituent principles
of human nature are not theoretically recognised in their
integrity; and it may also stimulate the unphilosophical to
a deeper and truer insight of what the natural principles
are on which men must proceed in their actions. But the
principles themselves are not reached by reasoning: they
are the inspiration of God; and it is this divine inspiration
that makes experience and reasoning at all possible
for men.</p>

<p>That I am an individual self-conscious person, to whom
something other than, and independent of, my individual
self is presented in my senses—so independent of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
individually that it can inform me of the existence of other
persons whose conscious life is numerically different from
mine; that the free agency of a person is the only sort of
power that we are obliged to recognise, persons being
revealed as responsible powers in and through our
moral nature; and that the powerless things of sense, of
which we are immediately percipient in our sense perceptions,
are interpretable for purposes of common life and
science, inasmuch as their changes must be determined by
natural laws, all reasoning being otherwise impossible—<em>these</em>
I think are the chief ‘inspirations’ or ‘revelations’
of the Common Sense on which Reid enlarges. This
account of those inspirations is not offered as complete;
only as results, more or less fragmentary, reached by the
deep and steady reflection of a long life.</p>

<p>Reid’s philosophical appeal to the divine inspirations of
the common sense, without which nothing can be proved,
on behalf of truths which do not admit of direct logical
proof, but only of a sort of philosophical justification, has
been disparaged as an ignoble retreat from the standpoint
of the philosopher, in the interest of popular prejudices
and blind authority. It has been spoken of as an appeal
from the reasoned judgments of the reflecting minority to
the unreasoned opinions of the unreflecting majority,
an opening for arbitrary dogmas to enter and crush free
inquiry. This is the drift of the criticism of Priestley
in last century, and of Ferrier in this, while Kantian
critics complain of Reid’s lazy arrest of philosophy at
the level of ordinary beliefs. Besides this, what Reid
claims as ‘the chief merit of his philosophy’—that of
questioning the common assumption that external things
cannot present themselves in our perceptions, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
unauthenticated representations of them—proceeds, according
to Priestley, on a misinterpretation of the metaphorical
language of philosophers: to refute it is an idle waste of
controversial labour, taking figures of speech for serious
science.</p>

<p>If ‘common sense’ in this philosophy means only
unintelligent opinion, as opposed to the judgments of
thinkers, Reid’s response to the sceptic may well be regarded
as an arrest of intelligence,—blind dogmatism
instead of philosophy. But candid critics interpret words
in the meaning intended by those who use them. This
appeal to the judgments named those of the common
sense, is intended as an appeal to reason itself—reason,
that is to say, in its final form in a finite intelligence,
whose experience of the universe is incomplete, and working
under conditions imposed upon its exercise in intelligent
beings who are not omniscient. Reid’s Common Sense
is the final perception of a being who can know the universe
of reality only in part, and is therefore needed by man in that
intermediate position in which an absolute beginning or end
of things must be to him incomprehensible. It is an appeal
to that which must in reason be final, in an intelligence
that only partly shares in divine omniscient reason. Although
its judgments are not evolved from premises,
they are nevertheless what all men, except infants and
lunatics, more or less distinctly acknowledge in their
individual actions, although they may misconstrue them
in their uneducated opinions, or spoil them by indulgence
in purely speculative systems. The divine inspiration of
the common sense is therefore man’s final support, amidst
the so-called ‘contingencies’ of temporal change in himself
and his surroundings. A philosophical appeal to it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of practical importance in reference to what, at the human
point of view, are contingent truths of moral reasoning:
the necessary truths of abstract thought, it has been well
said, ‘sufficiently guard themselves.’</p>

<p>Accordingly the judgments of the common sense which
chiefly interested Reid are what he calls first principles of
‘contingent’ truths, as distinguished from abstract necessities
the opposites of which are self-contradictory or unthinkable.
Contingent truths, on the other hand, may be
rejected in thought; but those who reject them speculatively
must proceed upon them in their actions and
reasonings, including even sceptical reasonings. The man
whose scepticism involves a practical surrender of the
common judgment, that what we call the outward world is
independent enough of <em>his</em> individual existence to make
it a trustworthy medium of intercourse for him with other
living persons; and who acts accordingly on the belief that
‘other persons’ are only conscious states of his own
individual mind, would be pronounced a lunatic. Again,
the fatalist, who rejects practically the moral judgment
that refers the issues of a deliberate voluntary determination
to the voluntary or personal agent as its responsible
centre, insanely sits still in the midst of danger, and refrains
from exerting a power which he denies. And he who
refuses to proceed upon the logically undemonstrable
postulate of universal natural order, by ceasing to reason
about wholly uninterpretable chaos, is inevitably crushed
by the Universal Power that he ignores.</p>

<p>It is thus that practical disregard of inspired final reason
appears to Reid to be ‘destructive at once of the science of
the philosopher, the prudence of the man of the world, and
the faith of the Christian.’ The unjust as well as the just,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
so far as they live at all, must, he sees, live by faith in what
cannot be either proved or disproved by direct demonstration.
And if all those final judgments of practical reason
were contradicted in daily action, as well as in academic
theory, ‘piety, patriotism, parental affection, and private
virtue would appear as ridiculous as knight-errantry: the
pursuits of pleasure, ambition, and avarice must be
grounded upon this sort of belief as well as those that
are honourable and virtuous.’</p>

<p>On the other hand there are common prejudices which,
while they last, are popularly dignified as ‘common sense.’
Some now universally admitted truths of science at first
shocked men, although afterwards found to be in harmony
with the general common sense to which philosophy
appeals. That we are living on a material ball that revolves
in space; that the revolving ball revolves also on its axis;
that the sun does not rise and set, but is at rest; the
existence of the antipodes; the invisibility of the distances
of things—are a few examples. Instead of contradicting the
common sense, the common sense, in the light of further
experimental evidence, finally imposes them upon us. At
any rate <em>their</em> contradictories cannot be justified by the
universal intellectual paralysis which is the alternative to
the rejection of a <em>genuine</em> judgment of the common sense.
The assertion that the earth is in motion and the sun
relatively at rest does not contradict sane human nature:
that changes in nature are all wholly chaotic, and therefore
wholly uninterpretable, can never become a scientific discovery,
because it implies subversion of all science and
makes scientific reasoning impossible. The invisibility of
the distances of things, rightly understood in the light of
its evidence, draws no protest from genuine human nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Human nature or final reason protests, on the other hand,
when the material world is believed to be so unreal that
I cannot by means of it find that there are other human
beings. The impotence of all things presented to the
senses does not contradict reason in the common sense in
the way the impotence, and consequent irresponsibility,
of man does.</p>

<p>But Reid, I think, makes too little of the service of
philosophical reflection, in quickening into conscious life
in the individual the postulates on which human knowledge
and conduct finally turn, and in developing their meaning.
Such primary assumptions as the real existence of outward
things; our own individual personal existence; and the
existence of God, are held with very different degrees of
intelligence, by the indolent and thoughtless and by those
who reflect. Advance in philosophy is advance in interpreting
the meaning of each of these three postulates,
and of their mutual relations, as seen in an improved
conception of what ‘matter’ means, what ‘self’ means,
and what ‘God’ means. The common sense or final
reason of man is developed in different degrees in different
persons, in different places, at different periods of human
history, and in the same person at different times in his
life. It is not individually independent of evolutionary law;
although its genuine constituents are latent in each man
and may be made to respond to an adequate appeal. The
practical reason of the common sense, while not founded
on but presupposed in philosophy, may nevertheless be
deepened and enlightened in each man by reflection and
criticism. Its final action is therefore far from superseding
the philosopher, who has to systematise man’s advancing
experience of the universe in the light of an idealised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
common sense, or the common sense in the ideal man,
which the philosopher tries to approach more nearly. In
this intellectual progress the cruder conceptions of ‘matter’
and ‘self’ and ‘God,’ as well as of the final physical and
the moral relations of the three postulated existences, are
purified and expanded; but always without disparagement
to the primary roots. Improvement of human knowledge,
in harmony with the awakened common sense inspirations,
is our intellectual ideal.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be said that Reid makes his appeal
to the root principles of practical reason—the essential
sanity of mankind—only on behalf of what no one seriously
calls in question; and moreover that he attributes the
scepticism with which he struggled to a speculative theory
of philosophers, instead of to facts in nature and in
man, which suggest distrust in the ‘inspirations’ on
which human understanding depends, in its lack of
omniscience. What need, it may be asked, for a prolonged
endeavour to justify belief in the existence of the house in
which we live, the planet on which it stands, or the human
beings among whom we seem to play our parts? Only
insane persons—really insane—can be found to doubt
realities like these. Insanity cannot be cured by an
elaborate disproof of the ‘ideal system’; and as for the
sane, such common sense sanities as these are safe enough
without this philosophical appeal to human sanity. As
regards those beliefs—<i lang="la">si non rogas intelligo</i>. I know all
that I need to know, as long as I am not asked to justify
and explain my knowledge, logically or otherwise, and
remain contented to enjoy the things that unpractical
thinkers vainly try to understand.</p>

<p>That sceptical distrust in our original faculties, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Power or Providence that is finally operative in the universe
in which we have our being, lies deeper than the ‘ideal
system’ which was Reid’s bugbear; and also that it arises
mostly in connection with less obtrusive elements in the
common sense than our perceptions through the five
senses, is in harmony with the gradual development of
Reid’s own thought which I have tried to trace. For he
advanced, as we saw, from reflection upon those ‘inspirations’
of the common sense that are implied in our physical
perceptions, to reflection upon those other data of the
common sense that are implied in our perceptions of
personal and morally responsible agency. It is in touching
and seeing the material world that the common sense is
first awakened; and thus the material world is the most
obtrusive object in human experience, its perceptions affording
the fittest preliminary object-lesson on the office of
this final reason in the whole rational economy of man.
External perceptions are the beginnings of all reasonings
about concrete existence. They are the obvious examples
of those original judgments, which are ‘the inspiration of
the Almighty,’ more obvious than the often dormant ones
that are moral and spiritual. All the discoveries of our
reason are grounded on them. A remarkable deviation
from them, arising from a disorder in the constitution, is
called <em>lunacy</em> by all; as when a man believes that he is
made of glass: but when a man suffers himself to be
reasoned out of them by metaphysical arguments he would
call this <em>metaphysical lunacy</em>; which differs from the other
species of the distemper in this, that it is not continued,
but intermittent. He thus tests reason in its final authority,
as distinguished from reason in its innumerable inferential
exercises: the authority may be logically vindicated as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
reasonable, but its judgments are not conclusions originally
deduced from premises.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that the Reidian protest on
behalf of a philosophical recognition of the blended judgment
and feeling which makes this common reason that is
more or less consciously alive in all men, is a protest on
behalf of the regulative authority of this reason in its
genuine integrity. All philosophical systems, so far, proceed
upon and acknowledge its judgments; but, as it
seemed to Reid, often only after spoiling them. He made
it his particular mission to restore them in their genuine
integrity to philosophy as the prime factors of all true
theories. In perception does the outward reality actually
appear, extended as it really is, without any unextended
medium interposed, exactly as the internal reality of a
pain or a pleasure appears without a medium, when I
am conscious of being pained or pleased? If so, let us
then, Reid would say, accept this fact as final, even although
we cannot account for it; instead of perverting it by supposing
that the external reality is one thing, and the
immediately perceived object of which alone we are curious
a different thing;—dreaming that this supposed internal
object, as its copy, explains our perception of the external
object that is imperceptible. Again, according to genuine
common sense, the ‘self’ which I am obliged to presuppose
is invisible; my body or my brain is external to <em>it</em>, as
much so as the sun and moon are; for they are all parts of
the material world—all objects of my senses—unlike my
proper personality, which is approached only through the
inner consciousness, and not at all through perception of
the senses. Here, too, Reid protests on behalf of the
genuine common sense, and against the scientifically perverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
common sense offered to him by Priestley. For
the distinctive feature of Reidism is not vague acknowledgment
of the common sense, but acknowledgment of it as
it is found to be when steadfast reflection is applied to
the final mental experience of man.</p>

<p>A modern critic may complain that Reid’s point of view
is too narrow and special, and his method too matter-of-fact
to entitle the result to be called philosophy. It looks unlike
philosophy proper, which is concerned with the universe and
universals, and is like a special science of human mind,
having human mind for its finite object or province, as other
special sciences have their limited provinces. For instance,
astronomy has the stellar bodies; chemistry, the elementary
constitution of bodies; geology, the phenomena in the
strata of the earth’s crust; and so on. Now the final
problem of universal reality, or at least universal reality
in ultimate relation to man, is the proper business of the
philosopher, who contemplates the all-comprehensive synthesis
which sustains or explains each special science, and
even the universe of nature and man; while, as human
philosophy, it still recognises the inherent infinity that makes
realities overleap the special sciences. For philosophy
is the supreme speculation, concerned with Matter or
outward Nature, Self or Spirit, and God or the final
all-determining Power—and of this final inquiry Reid
had hardly a conception. Yet we must allow that when
Reid’s method is called ‘inductive,’ it is more than inductive
in the ordinary meaning of the word induction
in the natural sciences. He does not reach the several
principles of the common sense by the way of probable
generalisation from observed facts; rather as truths
which arise out of latency into more or less distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
consciousness, in response to steadfast meditation. They
are philosophically recognised ‘inspirations,’ or ‘revelations’—not
tentative generalisations; and their justification
must not be confounded with the ordinary verification
with which we are familiar in sciences of outward nature.
The common sense provides material to the philosopher,
not ready made, but still not mere issue of empirical
generalisation.</p>

<p>How far a philosophy akin to that of Reid admits of
philosophical expansion, or of being brought up to date at
the end of the nineteenth century, when the fundamental
questions of religious thought are at the root of our doubts
and perplexities, may be considered on a review of the
fortunes of Reid’s appeal to the inspirations of final reason
in the century which has passed since he died.</p>

<span class="smaller">REID IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY: DEVELOPMENT OF
THE COMMON SENSE PHILOSOPHY: REID IN FRANCE:
REID AND HAMILTON: REID AND SCOTO-HEGELIAN
IDEALISM: ETHICAL OR THEISTIC FINAL FAITH</span></h2>

<p>How has Reid’s protest of reason in the name of common
sense—a protest against sceptical paralysis of human intelligence,
physical and moral—fared in the nineteenth century?
Has Reid by this protest established what is of lasting
value either to human happiness or to philosophical theory?
What has modern thought, as developed at the end of the
nineteenth century, to say to a Scottish eighteenth century
inquiry into human mind that finds its root in a postulated
sense of reality, which must be taken as finally authoritative
when it is recognised in its genuine integrity? How do faith
and doubt now stand finally related, as compared with their
relations when Reid opposed Hume? Is there still room
for philosophical argument founded on the divine inspirations
of the Common Sense, under, for instance, our transformed
conception of the universe as an evolution?</p>

<p>Expansion rather than subversion of the philosophy
which ultimately argues from the common sense, has, I
think, been going on. Matter-of-fact study of human
mind, as engaged in perception of the material world, and
in the moral exercise of voluntary agency, which with Reid
makes this perception of matter, and moral consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of free agency its prominent spiritual facts, has now risen to
criticism of our conception of the Supreme Power that is
finally at work in the universe in which we live and move
and have our being. And a less purely academic scepticism
than that against which Reid summoned the common sense
now confronts us. If Reid’s mission was to call attention
to our direct mental grasp of outward realities, by exploding
a theory which seemed to paralyse that grasp, it would have
been his corresponding mission now to justify, in name of
the moral and spiritual elements of the common sense, the
religious interpretation of the universe, which finds in
the facts of matter and man a continuous self-revelation
of omnipotent love and mercy—and this in the face of a
world which repels our more philanthropic civilisation, by
its abundant suffering and sin. Instead of philosophy at
war with common sense, common sense is now alleged
as at war with the finally moral and religious conception
of the universe, which Reid accepted as conclusive under
the premises of an old-fashioned natural theology. Now
universal natural law is supposed to exclude God, and
sentient misery to make theistic faith in the goodness, and
therefore trustworthiness, of the Supreme Power an anachronism,
which must give place to universal pessimist doubt
and despair. How can we rest with trust in those practical
principles of human nature to which Reid appealed, when
they and we are found in a universe so full of evil as
this in which we find ourselves? Are we not navigating
the ocean of life in a vessel that is not seaworthy? These
are questions now expressed or felt.</p>

<p>For forty years after Reid’s death the higher thought of
Scotland, represented by its leaders, remained well within
the old lines. It was still careful analysis of what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
presented in human consciousness, with a gradual decline
of interest in the metaphysical and moral problems which
Hume’s agnostic distrust had introduced even into Reid’s
modest treatment of the common sense. Scottish philosophy
became a search for natural sequences and co-existences
among phenomena, instead of search for firm
intellectual and moral footing in a universe to which we
are introduced by being percipient of an infinitesimal part
through our five senses. For a quarter of a century
Dugald Stewart was Reid’s acknowledged successor, less
original, and even less adventurous, than his master, but unrecognisable
in the ill-tempered criticism of Schopenhauer.
With dignified eloquence, wider intimacy with society than
Reid’s, and more learning, he applied inductive methods
to find the laws that determine intellectual character
and the education of the human mind, also to solve
social questions, in graceful language—all which touched
the popular imagination more than his somewhat prosaic
predecessor.</p>

<p class="tb">Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Brown, the young
Edinburgh Professor of Moral Philosophy, and colleague
of Stewart, raised a revolt against Reid and Stewart in
some of their characteristic philosophy. This brilliant
youth, minor poet as well as philosopher, had practised
medicine in Edinburgh before his appointment, in 1810, at
the age of thirty-two, to the chair of Stewart. In medical
practice he had been the colleague of Dr. Gregory, Reid’s
cousin, and so long his correspondent. Brown, unlike
Reid, was one of the precocious philosophers. At the
age of twenty he appeared as a critic of the <cite>Zoonomia</cite> of
Darwin, and a few years later as author of an <cite>Inquiry into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the Relation of Cause and Effect</cite>, which contains the essence
of the philosophy that was afterwards expanded and applied
in his <cite>Lectures</cite>. He died at the age of forty-two, leaving
works undistinguished by the deep and patient thought of
Reid, and diffuse in style, but abounding in ingenious
analysis—an interesting contribution to the logic of
physical inquiry, instead of appeals to carefully considered
judgments of the Common Sense in Perception and in
Causation. Brown recognised instinctive belief in natural
constancies of co-existence and sequence among phenomena,
and treated associations among mental states as
the chief explanation of the phenomena of mind. The
originative moral agency of intending and intelligent Will,
so prominent latterly in Reid, disappears in Brown. And
Brown, like Priestley, disparaged Reid’s claim to merit for
reversing the philosophical prejudice that ‘ideas’ are the
only objects of human cognition, regarding it as a metaphor
mistaken for a dogma. Indeed, the empirical laws of
association tend with Brown, as with Priestley, to be the
sole ultimate laws of mind: perhaps this tendency was
restrained in expression as much by personal respect for
Reid and Stewart as by conviction.</p>

<p>After Brown, philosophy in Scotland was for a time dormant—superseded
by Combe and phrenology. But contemporaneously,
in ‘the twenties,’ a philosophy more akin
to Reid than to Brown made its appearance in England;
although the analogy is not on the surface, and has not,
I think, been observed. Coleridge, especially in his <cite>Aids to
Reflection</cite>, published in 1825, insists with eloquent emphasis
upon the difference between ‘the Reason,’ which is divine
or inspired, and mere ‘Understanding,’ which generalises
the phenomena that emerge in experience: he also presses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the distinction between free agency, as implied in morally
responsible causation, and the mechanical order of nature
with which physical sciences are exclusively concerned.
‘The Reason,’ to which Coleridge appeals, corresponds
in function to ‘the Common Sense’ of Reid. It is described
as fixed and final; as in all its decisions appealing
to itself; and as ‘much nearer to sense than the understanding,’
for it is direct insight of truth, whereas understanding
must refer all its judgments to premises. That
man, because he is morally responsible, must originate,
within his individual personality as their final centre, all acts
for which he is responsible, is with Coleridge a postulate,
‘the proof of which no man can give to another, yet every
man <em>may</em> find for himself,’ and so see the true meaning of
the words power and causality. In short, this postulate
is among the inspired revelations of the Common Sense
that are contained in our share of Divine Reason. We
may speak of understanding as ‘human,’ with its often
discordant generalisations; but there can be no merely
‘human’ Reason. There neither is nor can be but one
and the same Reason; the light without which the individual
understanding would be darkness.</p>

<p class="tb">The philosophy that carefully measures its conclusions
by the Common Sense found its way from Scotland into
France early in this century, in arrest of the materialism
and scepticism which had taken the place of the spiritual
philosophy of Descartes and Pascal. In 1811 Royer
Collard, eminent as a philosopher and a statesman, was
made Professor of Philosophy in Paris. In that year,
when he was preparing his lectures, he accidentally found
a copy of Reid’s <cite>Inquiry</cite> at a book-stall near the Seine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
He was charmed with its contents, which thereafter inspired
his teaching.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Through Royer Collard, Reid’s philosophy
became the dominant philosophy of France, and it still
retains an elevating spiritual influence in the national
schools.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In 1828 Reid’s works were translated and discussed
by Jouffroy, a leading thinker in his generation,
who thus leavened thinking minds among contemporaries.
But Victor Cousin was Reid’s most eloquent and famous
missionary. He had been educated by Royer Collard in
Reid’s principles. His ardent and comprehensive genius,
however, became dissatisfied with what he called a ‘sage
but timid doctrine,’ and treated it as a vigorous but
hardly philosophical protest against the sceptic in the name
of uncritical common sense. In his enthusiasm, Cousin
turned to Germany for ‘a philosophy so masculine and
brilliant that it could command the attention of Europe.’
At first he thought he found in Kant the profound refutation
of the sceptic, and the grand constructive philosophy
he wanted. But soon Kant’s mode of expelling the ‘mortal
poison’ seemed as unsatisfactory as Reid’s, and he parted
company with him so far as to join first Schelling and then
Hegel in an eclectic or all-reconciling system. But in the
end the fascination of Hegelian thought abated. There
might, after all, be deeper meaning, and more capacity for
development, in Reid’s appeal than he had supposed. So in
his later years Cousin returned to his first love. His <cite>Philosophie
Écossaise</cite>, which appeared in its latest form in 1857, is
an eloquent appreciation of Hutcheson, Adam Smith, Reid,
and Beattie, with Reid as the chief figure in the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime a formidable intellectual force had appeared
in Scotland, in argumentative collision with those Germans
by whom Cousin had been fascinated, and also with
Cousin’s own eclectic assimilation of all philosophies. Sir
William Hamilton was warning his contemporaries against
the ‘masculine and brilliant’ Continental philosophy, and
energetically recalling them to Reid, by two essays in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>—one in October 1829, destructive of the
‘Philosophy of the Unconditioned,’ the other in October
1830, constructive, on Reid’s ‘Philosophy of Perception.’
The reconstruction of the philosophy of the Common
Sense, contained by implication in these famous essays,
was, in 1846, elaborated in commentaries which embrace
the literature of philosophy, in Hamilton’s <cite>Reid</cite>. The
Glasgow professor re-appeared in the company of the most
learned of all Scottish philosophers, educated especially
by Aristotle and his commentators, by Kant, and by Reid
himself, whose modest enterprise was now measured by
the profoundest problems and most comprehensive conceptions
of ancient and modern speculation. The magnificent
intellect of Hamilton raised deep questions among us that
lay dormant in Reid.</p>

<p>Hamilton in Scotland is so far in parallel with Cousin
in France, that—moving in opposite directions—they both
helped to <em>germanise</em> the philosophy which makes its last
appeal to the common sense. Cousin, dissatisfied with the
‘timidity’ of Reid, tried to reconcile a philosophy that
should comprehend the Infinite with the philosophy that is
confined to experience. Hamilton’s mission was to clip the
wings of the speculative adventurers. This made him put
the emphasis on the inadequacy of a human understanding
for fully coping with the eternal reality. While he praised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Reid for making the Common Sense in its integrity the
necessary criterion of philosophy, he claimed for himself
the special credit of distinguishing its necessities as of two
sorts—the one a positive power, the other the impotence
implied in finite intelligence. Hence human experience
rests on a conditioned, or (so far) paralysed intelligence;
and if omniscience only can be called ‘knowledge,’ while to
know ‘in part,’ therefore with involved mysteries, must be
called ignorance—it follows that man knows nothing.
Ignorance is then the consummation of human philosophy,
and its highest attainment is this discovery. ‘Our dream
of knowledge is a little light rounded with darkness.’ ‘The
highest reach of science and philosophy is the scientific
recognition of human ignorance.’ ‘Doubt is the beginning
and the end of all our efforts to know.’ ‘The last and
highest consecration of all true religion is an altar to the
unknown and unknowable God.’ Man’s knowledge of
existence must be relative to his limited experience and
intelligence.</p>

<p>The missionary of a neglected truth is apt to be one-sided
and even paradoxical, and strenuous expression was
natural to Hamilton. From his first essay in 1829 to his
last in 1855 he sought to show the inconsistency of infinite
knowledge with our limited share of inspiration in the
Common Sense. Accordingly, the negative and incomplete,
or what Bacon calls ‘broken’ character of man’s
knowledge, rather than its positive victories, is ever supreme
in the <em>Hamiltonianised</em> Reid, along with a recast of Reid’s
account of the Common Sense as involved in perception
of the outward things of sense.</p>

<p>The respective offices of Reid and Hamilton might be
compared in this aphorism of Pascal—‘<i lang="fr">La Nature soutient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
la Raison impuissante</i>.’ Need for the common sense with
which human nature is charged, illustrates the impotence
of man’s unomniscient understanding and limited share of
the Divine Reason. Taking those words of Pascal, Reid
puts emphasis on ‘<i lang="fr">la nature</i>’; Hamilton on ‘<i lang="fr">impuissance</i>.’
But both are recognised by each: it is a difference of
emphasis. Neither Hamilton nor Mansel excludes the
conservative influence of ‘<i lang="fr">la nature</i>,’ taken in its integrity,
in the way Mr. Herbert Spencer does, when he rests
philosophy only on the strongly emphasised part of Hamiltonian
philosophy. In Hamilton the ‘<i lang="fr">raison impuissante</i>’
is insisted on really in order to make room for ‘<i lang="fr">la nature</i>’;
on the ground that the logical understanding, here ‘<i lang="fr">la
raison</i>,’ is too impotent to be able to <em>disprove</em> the genuine
judgments of the Common Sense.</p>

<p>Brown’s rebellion against Reid early in the century, in
the interest of a universal physical causation or association,
has its parallel in Ferrier’s revolt, in the middle
of the century, against the Hamiltonian Reid, in the
interest of abstract metaphysics as opposed to uncriticised
common sense. In the name of philosophy he excludes
from philosophy all except necessary truths of abstract
reason; neglecting, as beneath its regard, the world of
change, in which Reid’s mixed and practical reason, or
Common Sense, had been offered as final guide. The
office of philosophy, according to Ferrier, is among the
eternal truths, which alone can be absolutely demonstrated,
and which relieve philosophy from ‘the oversight of
popular opinion and the errors of psychological science,’
which had been unworthily dignified as the final test of
truth. The natural beliefs of mankind, instead of being
worshipped as divine, are banished in Ferrier’s philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
on the ground that their self-contradictoriness is demonstrable:
the business of the philosopher, accordingly, is to
substitute ‘reasonable thinking’ for ‘common sense.’ The
‘<i lang="fr">raison impuissante</i>,’ emphasised by Hamilton—the ignorance
in which Hamilton revels—is not allowed by Ferrier
to be ignorance at all; for ‘man cannot be said to be
ignorant of self-contradictions that can be knowledge for
no mind, human or divine.’ Independent or unperceived
matter is not merely hid from man’s knowledge on account
of his ‘<i lang="fr">raison impuissante</i>’; it is hid from all intelligence,
because inconsistent with the <em>necessarily</em> mind-dependent
essence of Being. Pure reason does not need to be finally
supplemented by practical principles of common sense.
It is able to shift for itself without this surrender. The
conciliation of common sense thinking and philosophy is
accomplished by the submission of common sense to
universal compulsory reason. Opinion must submit to
demonstration, instead of demonstration, intelligible only
by the few, having to make way for the undemonstrable
dogmas of the unreflecting.</p>

<p>Reid, I suspect, could hardly recognise, in the stuffed
figure thus put up by Ferrier to be knocked down, either
the ‘common sense’ in which <em>he</em> found the root of a human
knowledge of the realities revealed in place and time
throughout the long experience of man, or the ‘perception’
in which things external to the individual mind make their
appearance ‘in part.’ The practical impassibility of disbelieving
the existence of other living beings, of discarding
memory as wholly delusion, of treating man as irresponsible,
and our surroundings as chaotic or wholly uninterpretable,
alike for science and in common life—these were
alleged constituents of the common sense with which Reid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
concerned himself. They all lie outside the demonstrations
of Ferrier, in which he unfolds his theory in forms of
artistic beauty and easy grace, which make him the most
picturesque figure in the succession of Scottish philosophers.
Yet Brown and Ferrier in the end helped on the expansion
of Reid.</p>

<p class="tb">Before Ferrier passed away in 1864, a revolution in the
conception of the universe was in progress in Britain. The
idea of continuous physical evolution of external nature
and of man, promulgated biologically by Darwin, and by
Mr. Herbert Spencer as the all-comprehensive generalised
law of a universe that was supposed to be the outcome of
unknowable Power, has become a popular creed within the
last forty years. Simultaneously, methods of development
akin to Hegel were introduced by Dr. Hutcheson Stirling
in his <cite>Secret of Hegel</cite>, and afterwards in Glasgow by Dr.
Caird, who adorned Reid’s chair for nearly thirty years—methods
for making explicit latent Divine Reason as what
explains and sustains the universe. Reid’s appeal in a practical
temper, to the mixed and moral reason in man, as that
with which man is inspired—an appeal widened and prolific
of deeper questions in Hamilton—was still too cautious
to attempt to formulate the mysteries of existence, in fully
intelligible principles, which should remove the darkness
around the ‘little light’ with which Reid was satisfied.
He would have looked with distrust at the more ambitious
intellectual constructions which seemed to be superseding
the common sense of human nature, as the human response
to the sceptic or agnostic, whose philosophical knowledge
turned all knowledge into ignorance at the last. Reid was
too human to be satisfied with merely physical generalisations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of sequences and co-existences of phenomena, finally
unintelligible, and therefore unworthy of trust; and he would
have been too cautious to accept a network of abstract
intellectual necessities, latent in the universe, as the last
and best human account of nature and man as actually
found in place and time. To rest satisfied with the
evolutionary generalisation he would have regarded as
involving the ‘common error of philosophers since the days
of Plato,’ in confounding moral agency with physical
causation. Of the magnificent Hegelian constructions he
would probably have said, what he says of Samuel Clarke’s
theological demonstration—‘These are the speculations
of men of superior genius. But whether they be as solid
as they are sublime, or whether they be the wanderings
of imagination in a region beyond the limit of human
understanding, I am unable to determine.’</p>

<p>The alternatives presented to this generation—either
agnostic pessimist despair or universal science in which man
is in some sense identified with God—final nescience <i lang="la">versus</i>
final omniscience—ultimate and universal problem of existence
taking the place of a Reid’s science of human mind—represent
the unending struggle between sceptical distrust
of the Universal Power, ignorantly worshipped, and reasonable
ethical faith in the Universal Power, with consequent
hope for men. It is in Scotland a new form of the war with
David Hume to which Reid’s life was given. It has been
going on since Socrates argued with the Sophists at Athens,
and since Job justified the morality of Providence among
the Eastern emirs. The eighteenth-century question,
‘What is Matter?’ has risen in the nineteenth to the
question, ‘What is God?’ The inspired Common Sense
or Common Reason of Reid seems to be sublimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in universally necessitating dialectical Reason, in this
Scoto-German way of resisting the agnostic. To fill the
place of the ‘unknown and unknowable God’ of the
Hamiltonian emphasis, human knowledge appears identified
and co-extensive with the Divine, in an absolute
idealism, presumed to be the only adequate refutation
of all subverting doubt. The ‘<i lang="fr">raison impuissante</i>,’ sustained
by and culminating in ‘<i lang="fr">la nature</i>,’ or inspired
common sense, is exchanged for what looks like a pantheistic
necessity that leaves no room for moral agency
in man or God, and which scorns the incomplete knowledge
that cannot dispense with a faith venture at its root.</p>

<p>Yet Reid, if he were now among us, might find the
common sense not superseded but idealised, in the more
articulate response of reason in man to the all-pervading
active Reason which the later philosopher identifies with
his own. That the common sense latent in man is the
inspiration of God is an assumption with which he started
in his <cite>Inquiry</cite>. ‘The inspiration of the Almighty giveth
man understanding.’ ‘The spirit of man is the lamp of
the Lord.’ So the common sense moral trust in God, or
universal moral venture, is at the root of all human life
and human knowledge, giving unity and vitality to the
whole. It is the ‘little light’—a ray from the perfect divine
light,—and the universe is interpretable for all human
purposes only in and through it. It is that in each of
us through which the inspirations in the ideal man, when
dormant in individuals, can nevertheless be made to
respond, in an ethical or religious common sense of the
infinite love and mercy of the all-sustaining Power that is
always waiting to be gracious—to respond to the inspirations
of Hebrew prophets and Christian apostles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>If ‘knowledge’ means only what is reached by the logical
understanding elaborating materials given by sense; and if
the name is denied to the inspirations of the Common
Sense, what those inspirations should be called becomes
a question about the meaning of a word. God is then
‘unknowable’ by man, only inasmuch as faith in the
perfect reason and goodness of the Universal Power is
more than an ordinary scientific generalisation. But if
we recognise in the Common Sense, and in its underlying
Theistic Faith, that without which all our knowledge
must dissolve in ignorance, then the faith must be accepted
as in reason the final ground of the knowledge; and
therefore as in us the last form of the universal reason, in
and through which what is divine in us protests against
limitation to an intelligence that becomes paralysed in
the absence of this its indispensable factor. If knowledge
means omniscient physical science of the universe of
reality, then the universe of reality <em>is</em> finally unknown and
unknowable. But if man <em>can</em> live in intelligible relations
to what transcends natural science,—call this which enables
him so to live, ‘knowledge,’ ‘science,’ ‘common sense,’
‘faith,’ ‘inspiration,’ ‘revelation,’ ‘feeling,’ or ‘reason,’—it
is treasure found for the philosopher.</p>

<p>Can Reid’s ‘common sense’ be sublimated into the
universal consciousness of Hegelian dialectic, and does
this translation of faith into absolute science constitute
the true ideal of Scottish common sense philosophy at the
end of the nineteenth century? Is common knowledge, and
scientific knowledge in special sciences, only knowledge ‘in
part,’ while the true philosopher may aspire to know even as
God knows? Must man thus claim omniscience as the
only fit ground of his protest against sceptical nescience?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Or, must his interpretation of the experience through which
he is passing be, even in the end, only an inspired faith-venture,
instead of the omniscience which elevates the
common sense into itself? Rather, must not the supposed
omniscience, which is dissatisfied with faith-ventures, because
faith is supposed to be blind, be itself only the common
sense under another name—but with its intellectual constitution
more articulately explicated?</p>

<p>Surely only omniscience and omnipotence can dispense
with the moral and religious venture of our inspired
common sense and its implied theistic faith, as the root
of reason in man—in his intermediate place and office,
between perfect knowledge and total ignorance. So understood,
Reid’s philosophy is <em>virtually</em> the philosophy that
makes its final appeal to the divine in man, latent in each
individual man, in and through whom the universe is
gradually interpreted as a revelation of perfect reason or
perfect goodness. True philosophy is then the moral and
religious venture which accepts and applies the principles
of common sense, in the assurance that, in genuine submission
to their inspired authority, we cannot finally be
put to intellectual or moral confusion. Faith in God is
latent even in the perceptions of external sense, in which
Reid found the first example of the operation of this
inspiration. Alike in the outer world of the senses, and
in free or responsible agency in man, filial faith, ethical
or theistic, may be justified by reasoning, although it
Cannot be reached by logic as a direct conclusion from
premises. It is our primary postulate, and not an object
of logical proof; therefore credible in reason while it is
not demonstrable.</p>

<p>In this way a humanised Hegelianism, which seeks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
restore or retain the often dormant faith in the perfectly
good God, and thus in the future of man, may even be
taken as in line with Reid, under the altered intellectual
conditions at the end of the nineteenth century. It
virtually appeals at last to moral faith.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Poetry in another way than philosophy expresses and
interprets for man the inspired experience that transcends
physical science and its logical understanding. And we
find in the great poets of the Victorian era an appeal
through the imagination to those elements in human nature,
to which Reid made argumentative appeal as a philosopher.
In this lies Wordsworth’s ‘healing power.’ His ‘Intimations
of Immortality’ express divine inspirations, through which
man learns to understand himself and his surroundings—inspirations
that, dormant, ‘fade into the light of common
day,’ yet, recovered by reflection, ‘in a season of calm
weather, though inland far we be, our souls have sight of
that immortal sea which brought us hither.’ And ‘In
Memoriam’ is Tennyson’s protest against the doubting
spirit of the age, on behalf of the final and life-determining
principles, which underlie creeds, belong to our earliest
childhood, and on which the wisest and best have rested
with a more or less intelligent consciousness through the
ages—God revealed in the ideal man latent in all men.
The human office of inspired common sense or ethical
reason, final for beings whose ‘knowledge’ must be intermediate
between omniscience and blind ignorance of mere
sense and feeling, is its tacit philosophy—</p>

<p>Our scientific interpretation of the ever-changing universe
at last rests on ethical theistic faith, and the Christian
revelation of divine love is responded to by the divine
inspiration of God in Man, in the form of the spiritual
Common Sense. If this be not so, we cannot rely on the
Common Sense, for it then belongs to a morally untrustworthy
universe.</p>

<p>Established on this faith, philosophy or theology, in
Scotland and throughout the world, awaits the sceptical
criticism and the spiritual healing power of the masters
of thought in the twentieth century, for its further development,
and application to human affairs.</p>
